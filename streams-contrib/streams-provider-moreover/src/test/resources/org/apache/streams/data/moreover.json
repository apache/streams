        "content": "Filed under: Investing \n  \nIn many ways fracking is America's miracle drug. It turned the energy industry on its head. A recent study has found that fears about environmentally damaging methane releases from fracked natural gas wells are overrated. This is good news for the entire industry. It will help it to promote natural gas as a clean fuel, even if has been extracted through fracking.† \n \nThe†methane† controversy \nAccording to the EPA, it is estimated that methane is the second common greenhouse gas released by human activity in the U.S. Regardless of your personal beliefs about global warming; low greenhouse gas emissions help to decrease public opposition to drilling. \n \nThe previously mentioned study found that the drilling industry can further decrease its methane emissions by making parts and equipment to higher standards. Given that these challenges are not related to the fracking process itself, a little R&D could make natural gas even cleaner.† \n \n\nThe drillers \nProving that natural gas is a clean fuel makes it even more attractive for utilities. Drillers like† Chesapeake and† ExxonMobil † will be some of the biggest beneficiaries from stronger consumption. Oil and gas drillers are continuously criticized for their carbon emissions, and many new techniques like carbon capture and storage have not been commercialized to point where they can significantly decrease industry emissions. Simply using high quality equipment that limits methane emissions at the point of extraction and transportation is a simple and cost effective method.† \n \nWhen ExxonMobil bought out XTO Energy in 2010 for a total of $41 billion it became one of America's top natural gas producers and frackers. In the last quarter alone it produced 11.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day or bcfd; more than three times Chesapeake's production. ExxonMobil is a diversified player with refineries, but as of the second quarter of 2013 it made 91.9% of its net income from drilling and upstream activities.† \n \nRight now oil shale plays like Eagle Ford and the Bakken are all the rage, but ExxonMobil has a significant amount of natural gas acreage from its XTO acquisition. As natural gas demand grows the price will rise; thus allowing ExxonMobil to bring more of its reserves online in a profitable fashion. The firm has a small debt load and a total debt to equity ratio of 0.12. Higher natural gas prices would allow it to deploy more of its balance sheet within politically stable U.S. borders.† \n \nThe news that fracking is relatively clean will help out the large natural gas fracker Chesapeake. The company is trying to brand itself as a diversified driller of natural gas liquids and crude oil, but it cannot deny its history. Before the crash in natural gas prices it was the star example of America's natural gas frackers, and this tradition can still be seen in its production.† \n \nIts natural gas production is expected to fall slightly in the coming years, but the company managed to produce 3.1 bcfd in the second quarter of 2013. Natural gas was a full 44.6% of the company's total revenue, making it a very significant item. Chesapeake still has a large amount of debt to worry about, with a total debt to equity ratio of 1.02. Rising natural gas prices will help it to clean up its act. Excluding gains and losses on derivatives, in this most recent quarter it received just $2.81 per million cubic feet of natural gas, leaving lots of room for improved pricing. \n \nThe exporter \nAnother firm that benefits from strong natural gas drilling is the export company,† Cheniere Energy . The firm is building facilities to take natural gas and cool it so that it can be transported overseas. Cheniere Sabine Pass trains one to four are already full subscribed. Train four is not expected to become operational until 2016 or 2017, but by then the company expects that $365 million in distributed cash will flow every year to† Cheniere Energy Partners . Cheniere Energy will see an immediate boost as it owns 55.9% of Cheniere Energy Partners. \n \n\n \nHenry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price data by YCharts \n \nWith low methane emissions from natural gas drilling, it will be easier for drillers to maintain a large supply of natural gas. Cheniere depends on the price differentials between the flooded North American market and more constricted Asian and European markets, making U.S. natural gas production a very important factor. Stronger U.S. demand will put upward pressure on natural gas prices, but it is very unlikely that they would rise to Japanese levels. \n \nConclusion \nDrillers are constantly being accused of destroying the environment and creating a global environmental†disaster. There is no way to completely remove their impacts on the environment, but the latest data shows that methane emissions are not as prevalent as they were once thought. \n \nBy improving equipment drillers like Chesapeake and ExxonMobil will be able to further reduce their emissions and boost demand for natural gas from environmentally conscious consumers. Low methane emissions and strong production levels will benefit U.S. LNG exporters like Cheniere, as it increases the probability that U.S. drillers will keep prices low relative to international levels. \n \n\nMore ideas from The Motley Fool \nThink the days of $100 oil are gone?

        "title": "Iranian president says he'll never use nuclear weapons",
        "content": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday his administration would never develop nuclear weapons, and suggested he had the power to strike a deal with the West on his country's alleged atomic program. \n\nRouhani made the comments in his first interview with a U.S. news outlet since his election in June. Ann Curry, an NBC News correspondent, conducted the interview at Rouhani's presidential compound in Iran?s capital. \n\nRouhani ?struck a conciliatory tone,? NBC News said. \n\nThe interview will air on the network?s nightly newscast Wednesday. Excerpts have not yet been released. \n\nPresident Obama recently exchanged a series of letters with the Iranian president.\n\nThough the two countries terminated their diplomatic relationship in 1980, the two leaders seem to be open to talks. Iran and the U.S. were close allies for nearly four decades , until the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. \n\nAfter Rouhani?s election in June, The White House said it would be open to engaging ?directly? with Iran on the issue of its alleged nuclear weapons program. Rouhani's predecessor, former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was viewed by the U.S. as an enemy. \n\nBoth the new Iranian leader and Obama are scheduled to appear at the United Nations? General Assembly next week. \n\nObama administration officials, however, have said there are ?currently no plans? for the two leaders to meet at the U.N., but that could change. Also on Wednesday, Iran released eight political prisoners, which has been a priority for the U.S. The move could prompt a in-person meeting between representatives of the two nations. \n\nObama will discuss Iran?s alleged nuclear program with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Sept. 30, in addition to the situation in Syria. Israel hinted last year it could launch a preemptive attack on Iran to defend itself against Tehran?s nuclear weapons. \n\nAhmadinejad has said that Israel must be ?wiped off the map.? \n\nTehran has never admitted to producing nuclear weapons.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, which is part of the U.N., released a quarterly report in late August that revealed Iran continues to expand its nuclear program. \n\nAccording to the report, Iran recently installed 1,000 advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges in one city, the report said. But the agency also concluded that the stock of uranium that can be further enriched to weapons-grade material only grew by a small amount. \n\nIran has also been a hot topic lately because of the recent developments in Syria. Secretary of State John Kerry said while meeting with Netanyahu last Sunday in Jerusalem that if Syria is not held accountable for its chemical weapons, it would embolden Iran. \n\nThe U.N. Security Council, meanwhile, will now hash out a diplomatic deal between the U.S. and Russia to eliminate Syria?s chemical weapons stockpile.",

        "title": "Retrophin Proposes Acquisition of Transcept for $4.00 Per Share",
        "content": "Filed under: Investing NEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Retrophin, Inc. (OTCQB:RTRX) today announced that it has made a proposal to the Board of Directors of Transcept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  ( NAS: TSPT )  to acquire all of the shares of Transcept common stock that Retrophin does not own for $4.00 per share in cash. Retrophin's proposal is conditioned on the completion of cursory due diligence and other customary provisions. Retrophin's proposal is not subject to a financing condition. \n \nLast week, Retrophin delivered a letter to Transcept's Board of Directors proposing to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Transcept for $3.50 per share in cash. Transcept's Board of Directors rejected Retrophin's proposal and adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (a/k/a a \"Poison Pill\") that prevents stockholders from acquiring more than 4.99% of Transcept. In recent weeks, three of Transcept's major stockholders have publicly stated their disapproval of Transcept's current strategy. Retrophin's proposed all-cash offer would provide an immediate exit for Transcept's stockholders at a 20% premium to Transcept's current stock price. \n \n  \nRetrophin expressed its disappointment that the Board of Directors and management of Transcept have not been willing to engage with Retrophin to ascertain the benefits of the proposal. \"Our proposal represents an attractive premium to Transcept's trading performance, and we believe that the proposal offers a compelling opportunity for Transcept's stockholders, particularly in light of Transcept's risky and controversial acquisition strategy,\" stated Martin Shkreli, Chief Executive Officer of Retrophin. \"We hope that Transcept's Board of Directors will respect its stockholders' wishes and quickly commence discussions with us regarding the proposed transaction.\" \n \nRetrophin's letter called on the Board of Directors of Transcept to engage in discussions with Retrophin and to provide it with access to selected due diligence in order to enter into a transaction no later than September 30, 2013 (see letter attached). \n \n About Retrophin  \n \nRetrophin is a pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of debilitating and often life-threatening diseases for which there are currently no viable patient options. The Company is currently focused on several catastrophic diseases affecting children, including Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and others. Retrophin's lead compound, RE-021, is scheduled to begin enrollment in a potentially pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial for FSGS during 2013. For additional information, please visit www.retrophin.com . \n \n Forward-Looking Statements  \n \nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, regarding the research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from current expectations. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Forward-looking statements in the press release should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect the Company's business. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. \n \n### \n \n777 Third Avenue, 22 nd Floor \nNew York, NY 10017 \n \nSeptember 18, 2013 \n \nThe Board of Directors \nTranscept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \n1003 W. Cutting Blvd., Suite #110 \nPoint Richmond, California 94804 \n \nMembers of the Board: \n \nI am writing on behalf of Retrophin, Inc. (\"Retrophin\") to express our disappointment that the Board of Directors of Transcept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Transcept\"), rejected our all-cash proposal to acquire all of Transcept's outstanding common stock at a price of $3.50 per share, that was outlined in our September 10 th letter to you. Rather than discuss our proposal or attempt to negotiate for a greater premium for Transcept's stockholders, Transcept's Board of Directors approved a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, a/k/a a \"Poison Pill\". We are puzzled by that decision, particularly due to (i) the 20% premium to Transcept's current market price that our proposal represents and (ii) the opposition expressed by Transcept's stockholders to Transcept's risky and highly speculative stated strategy to grow Transcept through acquisitions. Although Transcept rejected our initial proposal, we are formally proposing to Transcept's Board of Directors that Retrophin acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Transcept for $4.00 per share in cash. \n \nNotwithstanding Transcept's lack of engagement with us and the implementation of its Poison Pill, we and our advisors have continued to analyze Transcept's publicly available information and assess the potential benefits of an acquisition of Transcept. As we mentioned in our September 10 th letter, due to the significant value that we believe that Transcept represents, we may be willing to further increase our proposed purchase price if (i) we are allowed the opportunity to conduct due diligence and such diligence validates certain understandings about Transcept and its prospects and (ii) we are able to negotiate a definitive acquisition agreement containing customary representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions. We and our advisors are prepared to begin the due diligence process immediately. Additionally, we continue to support, and are willing to participate in, an open and efficient auction process managed by Transcept's financial advisor. \n \nDespite public and private protests from Transcept's largest stockholders, Transcept's Board of Directors continues to pursue a strategy of searching for an acquisition to revitalize Transcept. Our proposed all-cash offer provides an immediate exit for Transcept stockholders at an attractive premium. As a stockholder of Transcept, we believe that our proposed transaction properly recognizes the true value of Transcept. \n \nIf Transcept is interested in pursuing our proposal in order to benefit its stockholders, we and our representatives are prepared to move quickly towards definitive documentation. Our proposal will remain open until September 30, 2013, which we believe to be an adequate time to perform due diligence and enter into an agreement if Transcept is willing to engage itself and commit the necessary resources. \n \nWe intend to make this proposal public promptly after the delivery of this letter because we believe that Transcept's stockholders have the right to consider this improved proposal, to learn about the refusal of Transcept's Board of Directors to engage us, and to understand that the Board of Directors is placing our proposal at risk by refusing to engage with us on a timely basis. \n \nWe continue to stand ready to meet with the Board of Directors and its advisors immediately to discuss our proposal and to devote all necessary resources to work to consummate this transaction by November 1, 2013. \n \nVery truly yours, \n \n/s/ Martin Shkreli \n \nMartin Shkreli \nChief Executive Officer \nRetrophin, Inc. \n \n    \n\n \nRetrophin, Inc. \nMarc Panoff, 917-261-3684 \nCFO \nmarc@retrophin.com \nor \n(Investors) \nRx Communications Group \nPaula Schwartz, 917-322-2216 \npschwartz@rxir.com \n\n\nKEYWORDS: † United States† North America† New York \n\nINDUSTRY KEYWORDS: \n  \nThe article Retrophin Proposes Acquisition of Transcept for $4.00 Per Share originally appeared on Fool.com. \n   Try any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days .

        "title": "Generation-Y lawmakers form new caucus for millennials",
        "content": "Two of Congress?s youngest members launched a new caucus Wednesday focused on the nation's next generation.\n\nThe ?Future Caucus,? announced by Reps. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) and Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), will work to develop ?long-term solutions to issues facing America?s next generation,? the two said in an announcement. The young lawmakers are partnering with the Millennial Action Project in the effort. \n\n\"We look at working on issues like energy, infrastructure and education, things we know that are important for our generation,? Schock said at the group?s inaugural event on Wednesday afternoon. \n\nMillennial Action Project President Steven Olikara praised the two lawmakers for joining together to start the caucus. \"The first millennial in Congress and the youngest woman in Congress have come together to rally across party lines,? he said. \n\nSo far, Republican Rep. Todd Young (Ind.), and Democratic Reps. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), Joseph Kennedy (Mass.) and Patrick Murphy (Fla.) have joined the group. \n\nSinema, 37, joined the launch event Wednesday afternoon, saying that her generation of lawmakers ?lives in a post-partisan age? that cares more about solving problems than ?red or blue, or elephants or donkeys.? \n\nThe caucus would present a new image for the House, which is primarily made up of older, white males. \n\nAll the lawmakers in the ?Future Caucus? are in their 30s and 40s. Freshman Rep. Murphy, at age 30, is the youngest member in Congress. \n\nSchock joked, when asked about Congress?s image, that, ?as an eventual old, white dude,? he felt their group could work on long-term planning and bipartisan cooperation on common issues. \n\nGabbard pointed out that in the House, it takes groups like theirs to get legislation moved in committee and on the floor. ?With 435 members, everything is a numbers game when it comes down to it.\" \n\nBoth Schock and Gabbard shared a similar outlook, emphasizing repeatedly the importance of working together and building relationships in order to get legislation passed through Congress. \n\nThey also shared a microphone: When Gabbard?s went dead halfway through the event, Schock passed his over to her. \n\nA study from The Institute of Politics at Harvard University, released earlier this year, found that millennials (those under the age of 30) have a cynical attitude toward government: Only 39 percent trust President Obama to do the right thing, compared to 44 percent in 2010. And only 18 percent trust Congress, as opposed to 25 percent in February 2010. \n\nSchock, 31, was first elected to Congress in 2008 at the age of 27. At the time, he was one of four House lawmakers under the age of 40, Schock said in an interview with Gabbard on MSNBC?s ?Morning Joe? Wednesday. \n\n?I brought the average in the House of Representatives down to 59,\" he said. ?That was the average age. ? In January of this year, we swore in 40 members under the age of 40: 20 Republicans, 20 Democrats.? \n\nThere are actually 14 Democrats under the age of 40 in the 113th Congress and 20 Republicans. The constitution requires a person to be at least 25 years old to run for the lower chamber. \n\nThe average age of House members is 57 years old, with 90-year-old Rep. Ralph Hall (R-Texas) being the oldest member. \n\nAnd the average length of service for representatives at the beginning of this session was 9.1 years (4.6 terms), according to a Congressional Research Survey study published by Federation of American Scientists. \n\nGabbard, 32, became the youngest female in Congress when she was elected last year. She?s also the first Hindu, first lawmaker of Samoan ancestry and one of the first two female combat veterans in Congress. Gabbard fought in the Iraq War. \n\n?Clearly there is a frustration with the lack of action in Congress,? Gabbard said on ?Morning Joe.? ?We collectively feel a great deal of impatience in wanting to get results, in wanting to get things done and an unwillingness to accept ?no? for an answer.? \n\nShe said she and Schock have developed a friendship through occasional morning workouts together. \n\nAsked whether Congress being too old is a reason for young people?s indifference to Washington, Gabbard jokingly said, ?I would never say such a thing.? \n\n?I would,? Schock interjected. \n\n?I think if you put the 40 of us in a room and lock the door,? Schock said, ?we could come out with solutions that would pass the House and the Senate.? \n\nThis story was posted at 11:28 a.m. and was updated at 3:54 p.m.",

        "content": "By Gabriel Debenedetti \n \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald McGahn, a Republican member of the Federal Election Commission who has been an outspoken opponent of efforts to restrict campaign fundraising, is stepping down from the panel to take a job at a powerhouse lobbying and law firm in Washington. \n \nMcGahn announced late Tuesday that he will step down from the FEC - the bipartisan panel charged with enforcing the nation's election laws - on Friday. He will join the election law practice of the Patton Boggs firm, where he worked from 1995 to 2000. \n \nMcGahn, who was appointed to the six-member commission by President George W. Bush in 2008, is widely viewed as one of the most influential figures in the politically charged debate over the government's role in regulating campaigns. He has given voice to the mostly hands-off approach to regulation that is favored by many conservative Republicans. \n \nCritics say his aggressive approach helped lead to a series of split, partisan decisions by the FEC that effectively neutralized its ability to regulate elections. \n \nMcGahn's tenure at the FEC coincided with a period of significant changes in U.S. campaign finance law that have weakened efforts by Democrats and some moderate Republicans to limit the influence of big-money donors in elections. \n \nA 2010 decision by the conservative-led Supreme Court struck down limits on campaign fundraising and spending by corporations and independent groups. That led to the creation of free-spending \"super\" political action committees (PACs) and forced the FEC to review and revise its rules. \n \n\"I've been there a little over five years, and I felt like I had done all I could do. It was time for new challenges,\" McGahn told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. \n \nHe added that he was proud that the FEC \"is much more transparent and open than it was when I was appointed. ... Folks participating in politics (do) not have to fear the application of ad hoc rules.\" \n \nMcGahn, a former counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee, recently led an unsuccessful push to change FEC rules so that its lawyers could not share information with federal prosecutors without the commission's approval. He said this was aimed at restricting the actions of the agency's general counsel. \n \nThe FEC's top lawyer, Anthony Herman, resigned in July as a result of McGahn's effort. \n \nAfter the 2010 Supreme Court ruling, McGahn routinely voted against mandating the disclosure of donations, and stopped efforts to strengthen disclosure rules in an effort to minimize regulations. \n \nThe FEC has room for six commissioners, traditionally split between Republicans and Democrats. \n \nBut partisan gridlock in the Democrat-led U.S. Senate had long discouraged Democratic President Barack Obama from nominating new commissioners, and the panel now has only five members - two Democrats and three Republicans, including McGahn. His term expired in 2009, but he has remained on the FEC, awaiting a replacement. \n \nThe logjam over FEC appointments broke on Tuesday, when the Senate Rules Committee approved two nominees Obama put forward in June: Democrat Ann Ravel and Republican Lee Goodman. Both are widely expected to be confirmed by the full Senate. \n \n(Editing by David Lindsey and Jackie Frank)",

        "title": "Why Panera's CEO Is Going Hungry",
        "content": "Filed under: Investing \n  \n\"I'm starving .\" \n \nI'm pretty sure we've all occasionally aired this complaint between regular meals. But the thing is, some Americans really are starving as we speak. And in an effort to bring attention to their plight, one major corporate CEO has been going hungry this week, and his demonstration makes an important point. \n \nMany consumers aren't aware of it, but Panera has for years been taking this social problem head-on, raising hunger awareness and even helping out. CEO Ron Shaich has put together plenty of bold initiatives, such as five \"pay what you want\" nonprofit cafes scattered around America. (A recent experiment to serve a pay-what-you-want chili dish in 48 regular restaurants has been discontinued, as many consumers didn't understand that it was part of an antihunger initiative. It's being rethought in order to boost effectiveness.) \n \n\nRight now, though, Shaich is making an extreme move that few would expect from a CEO: He's walking a week in the shoes of the hungry. \n \nTrading places \nShaich is on a voluntary, week-long challenge to eat on a shockingly small amount of money. His self-imposed rule: to feed himself on $4.50 a day. \n \nThis is not just a trendy fast or a bizarre experiment in self-denial. It happens to be Hunger Action Month, and $4.50 per day is the amount Americans receive under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as the food stamp program. Shaich's timing coincides with the House of Representatives' consideration of a $40 billion cut to SNAP funding this week; the funding reductions would take place over a 10-year period and make 4 million to 6 million Americans ineligible for food stamps. \n \nShaich's grocery budget for the entire week is $31.50. While shopping for food, he experienced some of the problems low-income Americans face on a regular basis. For example, as much as he tried to choose healthful foods for his week-long diet, his groceries ended up being high in carbohydrates and devoid of more nutritious and costly items like fresh fruits, vegetables, and meat. Shaich has also been expressing concerns about making such a small amount of food last him through the week. \n \nFood deserts \nIn some areas of the country, poor Americans lack options. Wonderful do-it-yourself initiatives like community gardens are cropping up, and mom-and-pop markets do exist in low-income areas, but many people can only afford cheap, low-nutrition meals such as fast food and the sorts of grocery store items that basically amount to carbs and sodium in colorful packaging. \n \nAlthough many people believe companies shouldn't concern themselves with such societal issues, some help out anyway, knowing their profits don't have to come at the expense of people and communities. Whole Foods Market is entering some areas with limited choices for fresh, natural, and organic foods, and it appears to be embracing communities that many big grocery rivals likely wouldn't take a chance on. So far, it has opened a store in Detroit, and it plans to open one in New Orleans. \n \nThese stores will be fashioned for different demographics, and they can also help their communities in other ways. For example, Whole Foods carries items from local businesses. The company has always had philanthropy and community support built into its business. It regularly donates extra food to food banks and shelters (Panera has been known to donate some of its daily bread, too), and several times a year 5% of all Whole Foods sales go to local nonprofits and educational initiatives. \n \nWhole Foods' reputation for philanthropy is almost unmatched, but there's a more under-the-radar company doing its part to combat food shortages: Sealed Air , the manufacturer of iconic Bubble Wrap. \n \nWhat you may not know about Bubble Wrap \nSealed Air also makes wraps for food to reduce spoilage, which is part of the hunger issue as well. Although much of Sealed Air's campaign against food waste relates to environmental needs, the company's SmartLife initiative takes a holistic approach. \n \nFood waste hurts communities. According to Sealed Air, \"The food we waste translates into lost profits for farmers and producers plus higher prices for consumers and reduces food security for those who cannot afford enough to eat.\" \n \nTo take on this problem, Sealed Air is moving toward serious sustainability. Take its Restore Mushroom Packaging, which utilizes the inedible and otherwise unusable parts of agricultural waste to make biodegradable and compostable protective packaging. \n \n(Full disclosure: The shares of each company mentioned in this piece have been purchased for and held in the socially responsible, investing-spirited Prosocial Portfolio I manage for Fool.com.) \n \nSome hope to make it, some try to take it \nShaich's personal quest to gain a deeper understanding of what it's like to squeeze a dollar until it screams shows us that at least one CEO isn't hanging out in an ivory tower. \n \nSo many Americans -- including investors -- argue about which government programs help or hinder the U.S. economy, but I suspect many don't acknowledge the human side of what it's like to be hungry and struggling. Dining for $4.50 per day puts things into perspective. \n \nMeanwhile, given the looming SNAP decision, let's remember corporate welfare for a moment. In the grand scheme of things, we know that loopholes, subsidies, and other gimmes for favored companies and industries eventually trickle up -- rather, gush up -- to giant paychecks for many CEOs. I doubt many of them know what it's like to eat on a weekly allowance of $31.50. \n \nShaich's challenge is impressive; the best way to understand the plight of others is to walk in their shoes. There are ways all of us can help, and it's good to know some business leaders and responsible corporate citizens advocate philanthropy -- and an improved economy for Americans at every point on the socioeconomic spectrum. \n \nCheck back at Fool.com for more of Alyce Lomax's columns on environmental, social, and governance issues. \n \nThe article originally appeared on Fool.com. \n    Alyce Lomax owns shares of Whole Foods Market.

        "content": "Filed under: Investing \n  \nCapitalizing on booming demand for agricultural machinery, Duluth, Ga.-based AGCO is expanding its business in Russia. \n \nOn Tuesday, AGCO announced that it is forming a 50-50 joint venture with Russian partner Basic Element group's (\"BasEl\") Russian Machines subsidiary to manufacture and distribute agricultural equipment and spare parts in Russia. Beginning in 2014, and continuing over the next three years, AGCO and BasEl plan to invest $100 million in building out a new manufacturing facility in Golitsyno, Moscow Region. \n \nFeaturing 27,000 square meters of production facilities spread across nearly 12.5 hectares, the facilities will include a modern factory, as well as a product show room and agricultural technology training center. \n \n\nAGCO CEO Martin Richenhagen called the new JV \"a very significant step in AGCO's growth strategy for the Russian market,\" which he said \"has significant potential but needs modernization and efficiency gains.\" In its 2012 annual report, AGCO experienced some of its largest sales gains worldwide in the Russian market. \n \nThe article originally appeared on Fool.com. \n   Fool contributor Rich Smith and The Motley Fool have no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "11 Ways to Cut Pet Care Costs",
        "content": "Pets are the light of our life, but they can get expensive. Rather than give up our pets, we should be thinking of ways to save money on all the things they need. Just like other members of our family, we need to be conscious of where the money is going and where it could be spent wiser. \n 11 Ways to Cut Pet Care Costs  \n† \n \nIn this post, I will discuss 10 ways you can save money on pets. While most of them are for cat or dog owners, there are a few thrown in for small pets as well. \n \n1.† Try making your own kitty litter . With just newspaper and water, you can make your own pellets for kitty. It can be time consuming, but the cost of kitty litter is a huge expense, so if you get the paper on a regular basis, this is an excellent way to not only recycle, but save a lot. \n \n2. Consider rescuing an animal from a shelter before buying one. Rescue pets often make great pets for families because they have been checked out by a vet and most of them are spayed/neutered. Many come fully vaccinated and some even come with chips implanted in case they get lost. The fees are low cost as well. Usually less than $100 and senior animals (those that re older in age) are often cheaper or free. \n \n3. While it may seem like a good way to save money in the short term, buying cheap off brand food is not the best choice. Feeding your pet this over their lifetime can increase disease in old age and even shorten their life. Think about it as if your animal was your child..would you give them a strict diet of junk food? Higher incidence of disease can make vet bills soar. \n \n4. If you think you cannot afford the more expensive stuff, make sure you are looking for coupons. Many manufacturers of higher end food offer good discounts and you can even buy animal food online and get free shipping along with discounts. \n \n5. Consider grooming your animal yourself. You can buy clippers specially designed for cat or dog fur in the pet care aisle of most stores that carry pet products. If you are nervous about doing it, you may try watching some you tube videos on how to do it. If you are still unsure, you may want to see if a groomer can offer you a discount if you are a regular customer. \n \n6. Don?t go crazy over pet accessories like clothes, blingy collars etc. Pets don?t care. This can easily eat up a ton of money if you get carried away. \n \n7. Make your own pet treats . Dogs will love these peanut butter treats and cats will go nuts for tuna treats . If you are not that crafty, always look for coupons for treats. \n \n8. Shop around for pet care costs such as flea and tick treatments and prevention. There are many online places that you can have them shipped directly to you without the cost from the vet passed onto you. \n \n9. Did you know you can give your puppy his first shots and not have to take them to the vet for less than $20.00? Many farm and ranch supply stores sell the vaccines and needles and giving the shot is very simple and relatively painless process. Just ask the place where you buy it to tell you how to do it and where to do it so you feel confident in your ability. \n \n10. Consider getting pet insurance. While it may seem gimmicky, pet care health costs can be enormously expensive and while most insurance carriers for pets do not cover routine things like checkups or shots, they will cover the more expensive visits that require surgeries or procedures. Again, shopping around for these can be your best bet. \n \n11. For small animals, you can often find used cages and accessories on Craigslist. Just make sure they are in good working order, free from cracks and broken pieces and clean them up well with a good scrubbing. \n \nHow do you save on pet care costs? \n  † † † † † † † Related Stories 5 Uses for Coconut Oil Fun and Unique Quesadilla Fillings How to Avoid Grocery Store Traps †",

Just take your ad with you and let them know at checkout the competitor?s ad price. (Some Walmart?s showcase competitor ads at the front of the store and already have it programmed into their system.) \n \nPrices could vary by region. I also highly suggesting printing out the Walmart coupon policy and keeping it handy. \n \nFind more Walmart deals here. \n  † † † † † † † Related Stories Kmart: $3 off $10 Toy Purchase Printable Coupon $50 off $100 Purchase at Lane Bryant + 50% off Additional on Clearance Items Walmart Coupon Match-ups 9/15 ? 9/22/2013 †",

        "title": "Eldritch Potions: Plasmids & Tonics [PEACH]",
        "content": "Brew Plasmid   \nYou are able to brew eldritch potions known as plasmids. \n Prerequisites:  Brew Potion, Caster Level 7 \n Benefit:  You can turn any potion you are creating into a Plasmid. This changes the base price to the following: spell level ◊ its caster level ◊ 900 gp. An EVE hypo or tonic may not be turned into a plasmid. \n \n  Brew EVE   \nYou are able to brew eldritch potions known as EVE Hypos. \n Prerequisites:  Brew Potion, Caster Level 5 \n Benefit:  You can turn any potion you are creating into an EVE Hypo. This changes the base price to the following: spell level ◊ its minimum caster level ◊ 10 gp. A plasmid or tonic may not be turned into an EVE Hypo. \n \n  Brew Tonic   \nYou are able to brew eldritch potions known as tonics. \n Prerequisites:  Brew Potion, Caster Level 9 \n Benefit:  You can turn any potion you are creating into a Tonic. This changes the base price to the following: spell level ◊ its caster level ◊ 1200gp. An EVE hypo or plasmid may not be turned into a tonic. Spells that have instantaneous duration or that stop once discharged can't be turned into a Tonic. \n \n  ADAM and EVE   \nADAM is a bodies measure of how much it can be safely modified and warped with eldritch potions. Every creature naturally has a number of ADAM equal to 2 + double it's Constitution Score. Once spent, ADAM doesn't naturally increase and can only be restored through magical means and rituals. \n \nEVE is an individuals reserve of vital energy used to activate plasmids which are readied within their bodies. An individual has a reserve of EVE equal to the sum of their Constitution and Intelligence scores. EVE is restored from EVE Hypo's (see below) and through drinking water. Any day where you drink at least the necessary amount of water, you regain a number of EVE equal to your Constitution modifier. \n \n  Plasmids   \nWhen an individual imbues a Plasmid, the magic doesn't activate immediately. It instead makes the magic bond to the individual and rely on their internal power. Once the Plasmid has been drunk, the target loses ADAM equal to the spells level (minimum 1). If this would lower their ADAM to zero or less, they become \"spliced\". After this the Plasmid counts as Readied. \n \nA readied Plasmid can have it's effects activated with a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the expenditure of EVE equal to the spells level. A Plasmid can be removed with an eight hour long ritual, which means it is now longer readied and you regain 1 ADAM. \n \n  EVE Hypo   \nAn EVE Hypo completely loses it's normal effects once created, instead becoming liquid EVE. When drunk it restores points of EVE equal to it's spell level. \n \n  Tonic   \nWhen an individual imbues a Tonic, the magic ties powerfully into your body.  Once the Tonic has been drunk, the target loses ADAM equal to double spells level + 2 (minimum 3). If this would lower their ADAM to zero or less, they become \"spliced\". After this the Tonic counts as Active. \n \nAn active Tonic has it's effects active as long as you have at least one point of EVE. A Tonic can be removed with an eight hour long ritual, which means it is now longer readied and you regain 2 ADAM. \n \n  Spliced   \nWhenever an individual with the Spliced condition rests, they must make a Will Save (DC 20 + Plasmids readied + Tonics active). If they fail this check they recieve 1d4 points of corruption and depravity (roll seperately). A target may lose the Spliced condition if they raise their ADAM above 0, but this doesn't remove any corruption or depravity induced. \n \n  Examples   \n \n     \n     Spoiler   \n     \n     \n              Level    Spell    Tonic Allowed    Name       0  Detect Poison  Plasmid Only  Paranoia 1    †  Know Direction  Plasmid Only  Compass    †  Resistance  Tonic Allowed  Lucky Charm    †  Stabilize  Plasmid Only  Jump Start    †  Virtue  Tonic Allowed  Hardened    1  Ant Hault  Tonic Allowed  Pack Mule    †  Comprehend Languages  Tonic Allowed  Translator 1    †  Crafter's Fortune  Plasmid Only  ?    †  Cure Light Wounds  Plasmid Only  Heretics Blessing 1    †  Disguise Self  Tonic Allowed  Changeling 1    †  Endure Elements  Tonic Allowed  Blanket    †  Enlarge Person  Tonic Allowed  Giant    †  Entropic Shield  Tonic Allowed  Bullet Proof    †  Expeditious Retreat  Tonic Allowed  Aero Dash 1    †  Feather Fall  Tonic Allowed  Freefall    †  Feather Step  Tonic Allowed  Careful    †  Hide from Animals  Tonic Allowed  Blind Pet    †  Hide from Undead  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Innocence  Tonic Allowed  Devils Innocence    †  Invigorate  Tonic Allowed  Tireless    †  Jump  Tonic Allowed  Spring    †  Keen Senses  Tonic Allowed  Guardsmen    †  Longstrider  Tonic Allowed  Dash    †  Mage Armor  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Magic Fang  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Memory Lapse  Plasmid Only  Amnesia    †  Negate Aroma  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Pass Without a Trace  Tonic Allowed  Shadowless    †  Produce Flame  Tonic Allowed  Incinerate    †  Protection from [Alignment]  Tonic Allowed  Opinionated    †  Remove Fear  Tonic Allowed  Lions Courage    †  Restful Sleep  Tonic Allowed  Insomiacs Wish    †  Sanctuary  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Shield  Tonic Allowed  Aegis    †  Speak with Animals  Tonic Allowed  Poseidon Voice    †  Stone Fist  Tonic Allowed  Hammer Fist    †  Timely Inspiration  Plasmid Only  ?    †  Touch of the Sea  Tonic Allowed  Atlantis Burst    †  Undetectable Alignment  Tonic Allowed  Devils Halo    2  Alter Self  Tonic Allowed  Changeling 2    †  Aid  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Barkskin  Tonic Allowed  Armoured SKin    †  Blur  Tonic Allowed  Mirage 1    †  Bull's Strength  Tonic Allowed  Stronger than Hercules    †  Cat's Grace  Tonic Allowed  Nimble Step    †  Cure Moderate Wounds  Plasmid Only  Heretics Blessing 2    †  Darkvision  Tonic Allowed  Night Eye    †  Delay Poison  Tonic Allowed  Paranoia 2    †  Eagle's Splendor  Tonic Allowed  Born Leader    †  Elemental Speech  Tonic Allowed  Primal Voice    †  Elemental Touch  Tonic Allowed  Elemental Fist    †  Fox's Cunning  Tonic Allowed  Smarter than Einstein    †  Heroism  Tonic Allowed  Born Hero    †  Hidden Speech  Tonic Allowed  Whisper    †  Invisibility  Tonic Allowed  Houdini    †  Levitate  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Mirror Image  Tonic Allowed  Reflection    †  Misdirection  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Owl's Wisdom  Tonic Allowed  Understanding    †  Perceive Cues  Tonic Allowed  Detective    †  Protection from Arrows  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Rage  Tonic Allowed  Enrage    †  Remove Paralysis  Plasmid Only  ?    †  Resist Energy  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Spider Climb  Tonic Allowed  Spider Grip    †  Tongues  Tonic Allowed  Translator 2    †  Transmute Potion to Poison  Plasmid Only  Chemical Weapons    †  Tree Shape  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Vomit Swarm  Plasmid Only  Swarm    3  Arcane sight  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Beast Shape 1  Tonic Allowed  Animal Skin    †  Blink  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Bloodhound  Tonic Allowed  Bloodhound    †  Cure Serious Wounds  Plasmid Only  Heretics Blessing 3    †  Displacement  Tonic Allowed  Mirage 2    †  Draconic Reservoir  Plasmid Only  ?    †  Elemental Aura  Tonic Allowed  Ele/mentla Crown    †  Fly  Tonic Allowed  Hermes Step    †  Gaesous Form  Tonic Allowed  Smoke    †  Glibness  Tonic Allowed  Cheats Tongue    †  Good Hope  Tonic Allowed  Morale Boost    †  Greater Magic Fang  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Haste  Tonic Allowed  Aero Blast    †  Meld with Stone  Tonic Allowed  Earth Glide    †  Nondetection  Tonic Allowed  ?    †  Protection from Energy  Plasmid Only  ?    †  Remove Blindess/Deafness  Plasmid Only  ?    †  Remove Curse  Plasmid Only  ?    †  Remove Disease  Plasmid Only  ?    †  Speak with Plants  Tonic Allowed  Green Thumb    †  Thorn Body  Tonic Allowed  Thorns    †  Water Breathing  Tonic Allowed  Gills    †  Water Walk  Tonic Allowed  Poseidon Step      \n     \n  \n \n  To do   \nSplicer Class \nAdd in Reactive Plasmids/Tonics \nAdd in Attack Plasmids \nLittle Sister Stuff",

        "content": "In order to better serve enterprise customers, Phoenix-based UCaaS provider Telesphere (News - Alert) is said to have been pursuing an aggressive multi-year expansion of its private all-IP MPLS network and part of that plan include integrating network Points of Presence (POPs) in Texas, Indianapolis and Philadelphia. \n\nClark Peterson, chief executive officer at Telesphere, said, ?Clearly our strength is our ability to provide unparalleled Unified Cloud Communications solutions over a national network with its breadth and capabilities, supported by our own proprietary back-office systems that has been designed specifically to serve large nationwide companies wanting the very best in Cloud Communications. By the end of 2013, the largest network in our industry becomes even larger and Telesphere will have 16 POPs, covering all regions of the country offering more capabilities than any other provider focused on all-IP, cloud-based business communications services.? \n\nTelesphere, a provider of advanced all-IP business-communications solutions has been adding or upgrading new network hubs in Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles, to augment its all-IP network that supports enterprise hosted VoIP and data services. With more POPs deployed, the company is hoping to have access to more capacity than any other pure play provider of all-IP, cloud-based business communications services. \n\nThe POPs contain routing and switching equipment that enables a wide variety of network communications services and they connect various customers locations using technologies like high-bandwidth Ethernet over fiber, Ethernet over copper (EOC), DS3, NxT1, DSL, cable and traditional TDM. \n\nTelesphere claimed that more enterprise companies are choosing it for a complete solution because of the complexity entailed in building, managing and maintaining on-premises systems in-house or in private clouds, more and more enterprise companies. Its ?service-in-a-cloud? environment means minimal capital expenditure and reduced operating expenses.",

        "title": "Why Indonesian Stocks Slipped Today",
        "content": "Filed under: Investing \n  \n  Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.   \n \nWhat: Shares of Indonesia plays like PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia , Market Vectors Indonesia Index (NYSE: IDX), and iShares MSCI Indonesia (NYSE: EIDO) all slipped about 1.5% today after Bank Indonesia announced a new regulation on mortgages. \n \nSo what: The new set of rules are designed to control the purchase of second, third, or more homes, reinforcing worries of a growing property bubble in the country . Bank Indonesia is making the move to help ease real estate speculation and reduce the incidents of fraud, but investors are concerned that it will hamper economic growth in the process. † \n \n\nNow what: Under the new regulation -- which will be implemented later this month -- down payments for additional homes beyond the first one will be increased, with loans for those purchases only given if the property has already been constructed. \"We have seen an increase in the property segment for multiple house purchases and that is what we are trying to control,\" said Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo. \"We want to maintain healthy mortgage disbursements.\" Of course, with the Indonesian stock market now off about 15% from its May highs , Fools might want to take this opportunity to look at the region. \n \n\nMore compelling ETFs \nTo learn more about a few ETFs that have great promise for delivering profits to shareholders, check out The Motley Fool's special free report \" 3 ETFs Set to Soar .\" Just click here to access it now. \n  \n \nThe article originally appeared on Fool.com. \n   Fool contributor Brian Pacampara has no position in any stocks mentioned.

        "title": "Music 4.5 brings Smart Radio on the 24th",
        "content": "I thought that this might be of interest to a few people. Here's what the event is about:\nOver in the US, Pandora has more than 70 million active listeners, and is seen as the market leader of the streaming-radio market, but the competition is fierce from newcomers as well as existing services developing new streaming radio or personalised internet radio products and apps. Ranging from Apple?s iRadio, Clear Channel?s iHeartRadio, Last.fm, Songza, Sirius XM, Tunein, Last.fm, Slacker Radio, and Spotify using free mobile radio to convert users to its on-demand service, the market is expanding - and confusing.\nWhat engages people? Strip out the tech, what is left? Without the right content there is no business, no revenue. Musician and composer Jonathan Segel, formerly with Pandora, says: ?So the argument here should be: how much is one spin out on broadcast radio worth, versus how much one spin on internet radio is worth, for the songwriter. The internet stream goes to one person. The radio broadcast goes to many.?\nWhat is the value of radio content? Is there a specific and intrinsic value to radio content? Is ?traditional radio? sustainable in the light of the increasing number of digital personal radio services, some amounting to no more than curated playlists? Is it a case of ?Drivetime DJ? and ?Breakfast DJ? and forget the rest? Are digital music services also aiming to entertain, inform and keep company? How important is content, context and live connection versus distribution, access points and distribution technology?\nWhat are the new content formats developing, and how are they being paid for? Spot advertising, subscription, partnerships, promotions, and sponsorships ? is there a sustainable business model, taking into account the music royalty structure, for the fiercely competitive internet radio? How to monetize the long-tail of internet radio? What do the new generation of branded content and transmedia monetisation models look like?\nFull details at the Music 4.5 site: If you're interested in going you can get a 10% discount by using the code: PALMSOUNDS",

        "title": "3806 Homes Waiting To Be Built In Reading",
        "content": "Cllr Tony Jones writes:          Badly Needed New Homes Waiting To Be Built     \nAs at 31 March 2012 there were 3,806 new housing units ? ?homes? ? with planning permission in Reading, but not yet built. \n \nNow while we know that some of these are on large active sites, such as Kennet Island or Dee Park, many seem stuck in the current malaise affecting the UK housing market. \n \nThis could be summarised as a lack of available credit for first-time buyers and those wishing to move the housing ladder, with bank and other lenders demanding huge deposits and high interest rates for those lucky few they deem worthy of a mortgage. \n \nNationally housebuilder Bovis is sitting on at least three years of plots. At current house buying activity levels, it may have more than five years? worth of plots for its mix of three to five bedroom family homes. They are not facing planning delays because they are all parcels of land with planning consent. \n \nOther housebuilders are in the same position. They have bought plots in the aftermath of the crash and are only slowly releasing them for building as demand allows. Barratt Developments said lack of mortgage lending was holding back a ?sustainable? increase in housebuilding as it reported strong first-half profits \n \nThe Bovis chief executive, David Ritchie, is clear. He could build many more homes if banks were willing to grant mortgages to homebuyers who have only small deposits. \n \nSo we have plots of land with planning permissions for new housing already granted, people in need of decent, affordable housing, unemployed building workers, and service industry businesses closing. \n \nHowever, to get things started, there is no question where the barrier lies. Planning is a red herring. Credit, or the lack of it, stands in the way of demand and new housebuilding. \n \nAnd yet what is the Coalition Government?s response to all this? Cameron announces an end to the right of residents†to challenge planning decisions! \n \nTalk about looking at something through the wrong end of the telescope. You really couldn?t make it up! \n \n(Note: 3,806 new homes is roughly†the size of the ?old†Redlands? area around the university.)",

It is a group that has been established to help expat women thrive in Ethiopia. While I?m pretty sure they don?t run embroidery groups, there may be other women amongst that group who do embroider, with whom you could link up. \n \nI hope that you love your time in Addis.",

        "content": "Do you worship celebrities and entertainers? Have you thought that they have something that you could never get yourself? Well, today is your lucky day. All it takes is the proper motivation and knowledge and you can achieve any look you are going for. This article contains advice to help you get that look you want. \n \nSheer apparel can look good if done correctly. For example, if you find a blouse with sheer sleeves, that would probably look very nice. If your clothing is too sheer, you will look tawdry, rather than sexy or classy. \n \nCreate your own special style. Try to be as unique as possible, so that you do not blend in with the crowd. Of course, you will need the confidence to pull it off, but taking the leap and marching to the beat of your own drummer will probably score you more compliments than you think. \n \nAlways remember that there are tons of different options available to you when looking for hair accessories. These include things like headbands bows, extensions, and others. You need hair accessories in your wardrobe. For instance, if you desire a sporty look, put on a sporty outfit with a ponytail holder that matches. A night out calls for the perfect matching headband. \n \nTry to stick to darker colors if you want to look skinny during the day. Colors like black or navy hide body flaws and make you feel a little lighter. You should wear skirts with elastic waistbands if you are concerned about comfort. \n \nJeans can look nice when they are paired with strappy heels and a dressy shirt. Colored jeans don?t work for a more formal look, however. \n \nIf you are dealing with a problem with frizzy hair, never rub it with a towel after washing it. This will damage your hair and make it more prone to frizz. The best thing to do is wring it out in a towel. After it reaches the dryness of your desire, remove the towel and comb the hair. \n \nBy utilizing the tips you?ve learned to the best of your ability, then you should be able to obtain good fashion sense. Even if people do not have the same sense of fashion as you do, everything will be fine when they see you are trying to be fashionable. \n \nTo know further knowledge about on the article above you may check us at http://www.gladyswest.com for more information..

        "title": "Out there and at them",
        "content": "In many ways, the words Julie Bishop and foreign policy don't fit neatly together. At least not yet. After four years as shadow spokeswoman for foreign affairs, she is undoubtedly better known in the public mind for the pursuit of scandal about Julia Gillard's handling of legal advice in the 1990s than for debating the intricacies of international diplomacy.\n\nBishop proved an effective opposition warrior during Gillard's minority government, adept in Parliament or on television talk shows at delivering political punches, whether on the carbon tax or Labor's leadership travails.\n\nBut Bishop has also worked hard to understand the world Australia confronts as the Coalition takes office, building on a personal dream stretching back almost 20 years when she bought a copy of Henry Kissinger's seminal work on foreign policy Diplomacy.\n\n''She has invested pretty heavily in getting to know people in the neighbourhood,'' says Alexander Downer, a former Liberal colleague and Australia's longest-serving foreign minister.\n\nWhile Papua New Guinea has been a special focus, she has also met officials and politicians in Japan, China and Indonesia, among other countries.\n\nBishop kept up a heady pace while shadow minister. She invited foreign ambassadors based in Canberra to speak to Coalition MPs each parliamentary sitting week for what she called ''conversations in diplomacy'' and published regular opinion pieces on Fairfax Media and other websites on international issues - a useful trove for diplomats to now scour and assess her views.\n\nKurt Campbell, the US assistant secretary of state during Barack Obama's first term, is another who was impressed by how seriously Bishop took her job when in opposition.\n\n''In a parliamentary system sometimes that is a challenging task, to stand ready and wait, to prepare. But she has used this time wisely and strategically,'' Campbell told Fairfax Media in the lead up to the election.\n\nWhen visiting Australia, Campbell always made an effort to seek Bishop out and discuss current events in east Asia and elsewhere around the world.\n\nBishop now has the chance to transform these fledgling acquaintances into lasting friendships. Sworn in on Wednesday as Foreign Minister, she is the first woman in Australia to hold the job - although that is a triumph Bishop is unlikely to dwell upon, lest it draw even more attention to the fact Prime Minister Tony Abbott appointed only one woman to his cabinet.\n\n''I believe that it sends a pretty powerful message for Australia that we have a female foreign minister, given that of all of the foreign ministers in our region who have contacted me, they have all been male,'' Bishop says.\n\n''I don't overstate it, but it's a milestone that has been reached now. It is always easier for the next woman that comes along.''\n\nIt is unfair that Bishop has been described as a token woman in the days since Abbott finalised the new government's cabinet line-up. Hard work and persistence, even in the face of doubting colleagues or occasional ribald commentators, has taken her to this point in her political career.\n\nIn 1998, she surrendered a role as managing partner in Perth of law firm Clayton Utz for the relentless cross-country commute from the West Australian capital to Canberra.\n\n''Pure competence'' is how former MP Bruce Baird would rather people see her.\n\nBaird and Bishop were elected to Parliament that year and struck up a friendship. Bishop later suffered some embarrassment after seriously contemplating a move to state politics in WA on a promise of becoming opposition leader.\n\nBut as Baird recalls, it was a tense debate in 2002 around Australia signing up to the International Criminal Court when Bishop's diplomatic skills really came to be noticed by her fellow MPs.\n\nBishop was then the newly appointed chairwoman of Parliament's treaties committee, set up by the Howard government to review international agreements before an official sign-off. Embarrassingly for Downer, who had been a champion of creating an international court to prosecute crimes against humanity, this same committee looked set to knock Australia's participation on the head.\n\nJohn Howard had declared himself as neutral on the issue, but was thought to be wavering towards rejection. Bronwyn Bishop (announced this week as the next parliamentary Speaker) had run an eleventh hour and very vocal campaign warning that accepting the jurisdiction of the court would mean surrendering Australian sovereignty and could even put Australian troops overseas in danger of prosecution.\n\nFor Julie Bishop, then only in her second term, the dilemma placed her at the centre of a power tussle between party heavyweights. Yet Baird remembers Bishop delivering a convincing speech in the party room to sway support for the treaty, an intervention regarded favourably by her senior colleagues.\n\n''There was no doubt that the inquiry and committee was going down the path of rejecting Australia's ratification of the treaty,'' Bishop recalls.\n\n''It was my view that it was important for Australia to be part of this significant development in international law in relation to crimes against humanity and war crimes. So I set about changing the views of the committee.''\n\nThe episode was also an example of what several junior MPs, including former diplomat and now member for Wannon Dan Tehan, say is Bishop's consultative nature.\n\nShe sat the group around a table and dealt with objections, one by one. The outcome was a committee report in favour of Australia joining the court, along with a somewhat unusual acknowledgment of concern - but no damaging report in dissent.\n\nBishop wrote the foreword to the final report herself and, looking back, it provides an insight into her philosophy, of someone concerned about defending sovereign rights but with considerable sympathy for global responsibility.\n\n''The 20th century will be remembered for its unprecedented social and economic progress and the astounding advances in science and technology,'' Bishop wrote. ''It was also a century marred by armed conflicts so unprecedented in their scale and intensity that it may well be remembered as the most violent and bloody century in recorded history.\n\n''At the beginning of the 21st century, the international community is prepared to take a significant step forward in pursuit of international peace and security. Given international support, the [international court] has the potential to be a valuable and effective instrument in that pursuit.''\n\nAll this occurred more than a decade ago, of course, and, if anything, the world of the present is even more complicated.\n\nLikewise, Bishop has not always had a charmed run in foreign affairs. Barnacles have gathered, as they always do in politics - most recently a dispute over comments she made about Indonesian officials that ''what people say privately can be different to what they say publicly'', which she insists were taken out of context.\n\nEarlier, in 2010, Bishop was criticised by Labor for remarks made to Fairfax Media after Israel was found to have used forged Australian passports to enter Dubai and assassinate a Hamas agent.\n\nShe appeared to suggest many spy agencies, including Australia's, commonly use fake documents - a point her opponents might revisit given as foreign minister she will supervise the Australian Secret Intelligence Service.\n\nAnd she has also been criticised for sacking ex-Victorian premier Steve Bracks from a posting as consul-general in New York.\n\nAustralia has a small number of embassies abroad compared with similar-sized developed nations and yet significant international responsibilities in the months ahead, including serving out a stint on the United Nations Security Council and next year hosting the G20 leaders summit.\n\nBishop's relationship with her new department will be closely watched by those eager to see a boost to the funding of Australia's embassies and posts overseas.\n\nThe diplomatic service is not accustomed to a minister without significant experience in international affairs or, at least, strongly formed views. Ever since Gareth Evans took over in the late 1980s, ministers have come to the portfolio with a well-known world view.\n\nDowner was a former diplomat, as was Kevin Rudd, and Bob Carr was an enthusiast for international history. The one exception, Labor's Stephen Smith, was largely overshadowed by Rudd.\n\nBishop appears more open to advice and her thinking about global issues will become more apparent in the job. Drawing on her time in the education portfolio in the Howard era, she has already outlined a plan for Australian students to immerse themselves in Asia.\n\nShe is a republican to a monarchist prime minister in Abbott, but the two have found common cause in a focus on the region. Bishop has mostly steered away from grand schemes and sweeping visions on the state of diplomacy.\n\n''She is a very good master of the brief and will work well with the department,'' says Martine Letts, a former ambassador and now chief of the Australia China Business Council. ''She won't freelance, as people used to complain about Rudd and Carr. She is going to be much more predictable and reliable.''\n\nAlready Bishop has asked the department to produce a regular file of newspaper and magazine articles so she can canvass extra information.\n\nDowner also counsels that much of what Bishop will encounter in the international agenda will crop up by surprise. ''A lot of things are just beyond your control, which is a bit different from many domestic portfolios,'' he says.\n\nThat means being adaptable, and he sees Bishop as practical and pragmatic - not ideological.\n\nBishop is only a day into the job and already a punishing travel schedule pans out before her. She departs for New York at the weekend for the annual United Nations General Assembly - exquisite timing she says - with the chance to meet a number of counterparts in a short time that might otherwise have taken months.\n\nSyria and Iran are on the agenda, and her trip will also coincide with Australia serving as president of the Security Council - an irony of sorts, given the Coalition went to the 2010 election promising to scrap Labor's campaign for a seat.\n\nFrom there, she will return to accompany Abbott to Jakarta at the end of next week for much-anticipated talks on people smuggling and asylum seekers.\n\nThen she will go on what she has called a ''neighbourhood visit'' to New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore and back to Indonesia for a summit of regional foreign ministers.\n\nTrips to Japan, China and South Korea are in train, as well as India for another regional summit and the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Sri Lanka. A meeting with US foreign and defence ministers is also planned before Christmas, as well as going to Fiji on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum to assess what moves are being made to return to democracy.\n\n''I don't see it as a transactional portfolio, by any means. I see it as developing relationships that will benefit Australia over the long term,'' Bishop says.\n\nShe has some of her own foreign policy idols - Downer, the Liberal Party's Percy Spender (who in 1951 signed the US alliance treaty) and Richard Casey (whose name adorns the headquarters of the Foreign Affairs Department). Even Labor's Gareth Evans is cited as someone who still commands foreign respect. Bishop says if she came to be considered in the same vein, she'd leave the job happy.\n\n''My aim is to be the very best foreign minister that Australia could wish for. Is that a high enough standard for you?''\n\nDaniel Flitton is senior correspondent.",

        "content": "Tim Duy, No Taper Yet.\n\nThe question for the Fed today was whether to set in motion a \"tapering\" of monthly asset purchases: reduce the amount of purchases this month from the current $85 billion to, say, $75 billion, as the first of a succession of cuts over the coming months. If I had been at today's FOMC meeting, I would have argued that (1) data do not indicate enough (any?) strengthening in the economy that would justify reducing the pace of asset purchases; (2) in a month there could very well be a government shutdown or a default crisis that makes a tapering move today irrelevant; why start on a new path from which there's a good chance we will have to deviate in a month? (3) in a couple of months we will know who the new Fed Chair is; why commit to a path today that the new Fed Chair may not support? We won't know what was said in the meeting until the Minutes come out next month and the Transcript is released in five years, but whatever happened, the FOMC made the right call.\n\nLizette Alvarez and Robert Pear, Florida Among States Undercutting Health Care Enrollment\n\nSuppose I grant you your claims about Obamacare: it's expensive, there's too much government regulation in it, heck, I'll even give you (for the sake of argument) death panels. Even with all those flaws, you have to agree that next month when the exchanges open, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people will for the first time be able to buy health insurance, go to the doctor, seek treatment for their illnesses. What can you say about politicians in states like Florida who out of spite are going out of their way to prevent their constituents from finding out about the health care options that will be available, options that are literally a matter of life and death for them?\n\nSteven Lee Myers and Rick Gladstone, Russia Denounces UN Chemical Report on Syria\n\nThe Russians are devious and duplicitous in many ways, and I would not trust them much on anything. But I think Russia has a genuine national security interest in seeing Syria's chemical weapons removed and destroyed. No country has a greater interest than Russia in seeing that radical al Qaeda affiliated groups don't capture chemical weapons to use in terrorist attacks. I am therefore cautiously optimistic that the US-Russia agreement to disarm Syria will hold.",

        "title": "Boeing to close assembly line for C-17 transport jet (Reuters)",
        "content": "By Alwyn Scott\n\nSEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday that it would stop making its distinctive-looking C-17 military transport plane in 2015 due to faltering sales, and would lay off 3,000 employees involved in the 30-year-old program.\n\nThe Chicago-based aerospace company said it would take a charge of less than $100 million in the current quarter to halt C-17 production in Long Beach, California, and facilities in Macon, Georgia, Mesa, Arizona and St. Louis, Missouri. It said the charge would not alter its forecast for full year earnings.\n\nThe move also affects more than 650 suppliers in 44 U.S. states, who employ about 20,000 people, Boeing said.\n\nBoeing plans to start reducing the workforce in early 2014, and has 22 more of the planes to produce. It has delivered 257 of the jets so far, of which 223 went to the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThe potential end of production had been signalled when the U.S. Air Force stopped buying the bulky, four-engine jet, capable of carrying tanks, heavy machinery and medical supplies around the globe. Foreign sales failed to make up for the loss of U.S. military orders, and the Air Force took delivery of its final new C-17 last week.\n\n\"Our customers around the world face very tough budget environments,\" said Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division, in a statement.\n\n\"While the desire for the C-17's capabilities is high, budgets cannot support additional purchases in the timing required to keep the production line open.\"\n\n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Bernard Orr)",

Orbital Sciences Corp. launched its first-ever supply ship from Virginia's Eastern Shore, the departing point for a NASA moonshot less than two weeks ago. \"Look out ISS, here we come,\" the company said in a tweet. The capsule named Cygnus ? bearing 1,300 pounds of food, clothing and goodies for the astronauts ? is due at the orbiting outpost on Sunday, following four days of testing. The Virginia-based Orbital Sciences is only the second business to attempt a shipment like this. The California-based SpaceX company has been delivering station supplies for more than a year under a NASA contract. Orbital Sciences' unmanned Antares rocket ? named for the bright red star ? blasted into a clear sky from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. A test launch in April went well. So did this one, with a camera on the rocket providing dramatic views of the coastline. The entire commercial effort dates back five years. It was Wallops' second high-profile launch this month. On Sept. 6, the company took part in a NASA moonshot that dazzled skywatchers along the East Coast. Wednesday's late-morning liftoff, while at a much more convenient hour, was not nearly as visible because of the daylight. The three space station residents, circling 260 miles high, watched the launch via a live link provided by Mission Control in Houston. \"Good luck!\" space station astronaut Karen Nyberg said in a tweet. She's expecting a fresh stash of chocolate. Come Sunday, Nyberg and Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano will use the space station's robot arm to grab Cygnus from orbit and attach it to the space station. Also on board is a Russian. The crew will double in size next week when another American and two Russians lift off aboard a Russian rocket from Kazakhstan. NASA is paying Orbital Sciences and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, to keep the space station stocked since the retirement of the shuttles. The other countries involved in the station count also make deliveries. The bigger SpaceX Dragon capsule has the advantage of returning items to Earth. The Cygnus will be filled with station trash and cut loose for a fiery destruction upon re-entry. That's how the Russian, European and Japanese supply ships wind up, too ? as incinerators. \"We categorize it as disposable cargo,\" said Orbital Sciences' executive vice president, Frank Culbertson. \"Others may call it trash.\" If all goes well, Orbital Sciences hopes to launch another Cygnus in December, right before Christmas. That will be the first true operational mission under a $1.9 billion contract. The SpaceX contract is worth $1.6 billion. SpaceX is working to modify its Dragon capsule for space station crews, so NASA doesn't have to keep paying tens of millions of dollars to the Russians per ticket. Orbital Sciences envisions strictly non-human payloads for the Cygnus ? but not necessarily just in Earth's backyard. \"We'd be happy to help a mission go to Mars,\" said Culbertson, a former astronaut who lived on the space station in 2001. On Wednesday at least, the focus was low-Earth orbit. \"This is a big deal for us,\" Culbertson said. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital Sciences Corp.: http://www.orbital.com/\rCOMMENTS ADVISORY: Users are solely responsible for opinions they post here; comments do not reflect the views of The Virginian-Pilot or its websites.

Example was the kale harvested for lunch ~ †(the caterpillar provided an additional science lesson, not protein) \n \nWhenever I head to the garden I feel like the pied piper, because everyone runs to follow me into, through and back to the house with produce in our hands. The herb garden means smelling everything before deciding which herbs to harvest for today?s meal. \n \nLots of healthy eating habits being reinforced and finding new options for old favorites like French Fries.† \n \nCheck here for the recipe for our Homemade French Fries , which is posted on our Cooking blog.",

        "title": "PRECISION MEASUREMENT OF FERRITE CONTENT AND WELD SEAMS",
        "content": "Components found in industrial plants ? whether chemical, energy, petrochemical or other ? are often subject to heat, aggressive agents and high pressure. These conditions demand steel types that are extremely corrosion and acid resistant even at high temperatures. \n \nFischer has developed a the handheld FERITSCOPEÆ FMP30 instrument to meet specific industry requirements. \n \nWhen austenitic steels are used, it is important to make sure the ferrite content of the weld seams is within strict norms, because only the optimal ferrite content can ensure the best corrosion protection. For this reason some industries have set standards, specifications and regulations for ferrite content. \n \nDuring the welding of joints on e.g. boilers and pipelines made of austenitic steel, the heat causes modifications in the crystal lattice structure which lead to the formation of ferrite. Weld seams that are poor in ferrite do not have as much yield strength, but too much ferrite reduces their fracture toughness ductility and corrosion resistance, so it is important that the welding process produces just the right amount. \n \nWith duplex steel in particular, the ferrite content in the heat affected zone can easily deviate from the target values, either due to unsuitable filler materials or through incorrect heat input or cooling during the welding. Only onsite spot measurements can provide assurance that the processing did not change the ferrite content at the expense of crucial mechanical or corrosion-resistance properties. \n \nThe FERITSCOPEÆ FMP30 can be outfitted with a variety of probes in special shapes such as axial, angled or for measuring inside center holes. It also allows for reliable and precise determination of the ferrite content in percent or as a WRC ferrite number. The technology measures the ferrite content using the magnetic induction method and displays it either as percent ferrite content or as a WRC (Welding Research Council) ferrite number. \n \nwww.fischer-technology.com",

We started in the spring and when we got through the books the first time, she immediately wanted to start over again. When asked if she wanted to join us, Davey said she \"would listen to chapter books when she was older\" but she ended up listening to some of the last few Ramona books we read which was fun.\nAndrew and Malia have been reading the Chronicles of Narnia for a couple of years and they are in the final chapters of their second read through of the series too.\nThe funny thing is I don't think I could get Malia to read Narnia with me or Ramona with Andrew.\n† At the end of the summer, Alli recommended the Mercy Watson series by Kate DiCamillo to us. Malia and Davey loved the books and so I looked for other stuff she wrote and came across the Bink and Gollie series which we all love.",

        "content": "As communities face challenges to feed the needy and food banks struggle to keep shelves stocked, Gov. Jack Markell, D-Del., made his way to Shoprite of Four Seasons in Newark to help raise awareness about the issue of hunger. \n\nThroughout the year, ShopRite Partners In Caring, a community based charity, encourages people to donate money or take action some other way by helping with initiatives to fight hunger. On Wednesday, Gov. Markell declared September 18th as \"ShopRite Partners In Caring Day\" and even switched roles to bag groceries at the store too. \n\n\"I enjoyed it because the people at ShopRite are so nice and the customers at ShopRite are so nice so it was a lot of fun. This brings me back to my roots I started my work career at a Friendly's Restaurant and women's clothing store so I've done these kinds of jobs before,\" said Markell. \n\nAccording to Chris Kenny, the owner of the ShopRite of Four Seasons, the vsit from the governor was well received especially since September is National Hunger Action Month. \n\n\"We understand being in the food business where people need sustenance and support and really feeding their families on a day to day basis so we try to do whatever we can to support the food bank and other food pantries that are helping to meet that need which we know is growing in these difficult economic times,\" said Kenny. \n\n\"ShopRite Partners In Caring\" has donated $30 million to local food banks since it started in 1999, supporting more than 1,700 charities in the northeast region.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A failure by Congress to raise the U.S. debt limit in time to avoid a default would spark a severe recession, a prominent economist warned lawmakers on Wednesday. \n \nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told the congressional Joint Economic Committee that the U.S. Treasury will be unable to meet all of its payment obligations as early as October 18 and by November 1 at the latest without an increase in the $16.7 trillion borrowing cap. \n \nHe said up until early October, financial markets, which have been \"desensitized\" by past budget battles, will anticipate a last minute deal by Congress. \n \nFinancial markets will start to get jittery by early October if there is no clear path to a deal, Zandi said. That will turn into panic once Treasury can't make payments. \n \n\"If you don't do it in time, confidence will evaporate, consumer confidence will sharply decline,\" Zandi said. \"Businesses will stop hiring, consumers will stop spending, the stock market will fall significantly in value, borrowing costs for businesses and households will rise.\" \n \nHe said if the government can only spend what it takes in, about nine percent of U.S. economic output will evaporate. \n \n\"We'll be in the middle of a very severe recession and I don't see how we get out of it. There's no monetary policy response in the current context. We're already at zero interest rates.\" \n \n(Reporting by David Lawder; editing by Andrew Hay)",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AFP) - Iran's new President Hassan Rowhani on Wednesday praised his US counterpart Barack Obama for taking a \"positive\" approach in an exchange of letters.\n\n\"From my point of view, the tone of the letter was positive and constructive,\" Rowhani told NBC News ahead of a visit to the UN General Assembly in New York.\n\n\"It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,\" Rowhani said, according to the US network's website.\n\n\"I believe the leaders in all countries could think in their national interest and they should not be under the influence of pressure groups. I hope to witness such an atmosphere in the future,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nNBC News, which planned to broadcast the interview later Wednesday, said Rowhani also pledged not to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nRowhani, considered a moderate within Iran's clerical state, swept to power in June elections on promises to work to repair the troubled economy and to ease tensions with the West.\n\nThe United States has spearheaded painful sanctions that have hobbled the Iranian economy over Western and Israeli concerns that the regime is developing nuclear weapons.\n\nIran has long insisted that its sensitive uranium work is intended for a civilian program.\n\nRowhani will face close scrutiny when he visits New York next week to deliver a speech at the UN General Assembly.\n\nObama has pledged to test the chance for diplomacy with Iran and revealed several days ago that he exchanged letters with Rowhani.\n\nBut the White House has played down speculation that the US and Iranian leaders could hold a historic meeting in New York.\n\n\"There is an opportunity here for diplomacy,\" Obama said in an interview Tuesday with the Spanish-language television network Telemundo.\n\n\"I hope the Iranians take advantage of it. There are indications that Rowhani, the new president, is somebody who is looking to open dialogue with the West and with the United States -- in a way that we haven't seen in the past.\n\n\"And so we should test it,\" Obama said.\n\nAt the very least, Rowhani is virtually certain to project a different image at the UN than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was known for his harsh denunciations of Israel and questioning of the Holocaust.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described Rowhani as a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" and threatened military action to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb.",

We had no idea that Hello Kitty was SO popular in Taiwan that five of EVA Airways jets are dedicated to the cartoon figure. The exterior and interior of the planes carry the theme from pillows to bathroom toiletries to in-flight dining. The kids meals are especially cute and feature Kitty shaped pasta. So far the Hello Kitty fleet is highly profitable.  Maybe we could have an Elvis jet in America.",

        "content": "Georgetown: Today at a simple ceremony held at the Theater Guild, His Excellency, President Donald Ramotar, along with the Ministry of Education, presented one laptop computer to each of the students who placed in the top one percent in this year?s National Grade Six Assessment (NGSA) examinations held in March. The top one percent amounted to one hundred and seventy-three students from all over Guyana. In underscoring his government?s unwavering commitment for education and the development of Guyana?s human capital, President Ramotar said: ?We need to ensure that we have equal opportunities for everyone?I do not know of a better way of providing equal opportunities for everyone,† than providing equal quality education for everyone in this country.? The president further pointed out that education has the potential to alleviate poverty and to provide a better quality of life. He urged the children gathered to take advantage of the opportunities being offered now by his government as it works relentlessly to provide the best education possible for Guyanese children. Also delivering remarks at this event was the Honorable Minister of Education, Ms. Priya Manickchand. She reaffirmed her government?s commitment to continuous development of the education sector to ensure that all Guyanese children have access to high-quality education. ?Education in Guyana is extremely important. It is the priority item of the government,? she said. ?This sector is treated very specially in the sense that many of our needs are met and many of the resources we ask for are granted.? Even while celebrating the achievement of the children present, the minister was keen to point out that much work still has to be done to achieve a higher level of quality education in Guyana. She urged the students gathered to make full use of the opportunities and tools being provided by the ministry and to strive to be better students and to ultimately work to make Guyana a better place. The minister also alluded to Guyana?s proud achievement of achieving one of the critical millennium goals of providing universal primary education to the children of Guyana. ?I am very pleased to tell you that in Guyana every child that is in the primary age cohort can attend a primary school. This is a very proud achievement for our nation,? the minister said.† Over the last two decades, the government has made big efforts to invest significantly in education. It recognizes the strategic role of education as something that must be given priority in the national economic development and modernization efforts of Guyana. Therefore, through the Ministry of Education, the government will continue to forge ahead with its education reform policies amply supported by strategic investments in the education sector. †Since enhancing the quality of education in Guyana is the core mission of the education reform policies of the Guyana government, significant all-round development of the country will be assured. † †",

        "content": "Commercial flights to Zamboanga City will resume starting Thursday after the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) issued a notice to airman which reopened the international airport ? closed since Sept. 9 when MNLF fighters laid siege upon the city in an effort to declare sovereignty by raising a flag at the City Hall. \n\nIn a statement, CAAP the lifted the notice to airman (Notam) which suspended the commercial operations until Sept. 21 as the security situation at the Zamboanga International Airport starts to improve. \n\nCAAP Director General William K. Hotchkiss lll told reporters the government authorized two commercial flights starting tomorrow ? one each for PAL Express and Cebu Pacific, and two each on Friday. \n\nDeputy Director General Captain John C. Andrews will board be onboard to overseas the first flight from NAIA to Zamboanga on Thursday, said\n\nHotchkiss. \n\nLast Friday, Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific cited a CAAP order extending the closure of the Zamboanga airport because of security concerns in the city and the\n\ncancellation of flights of both carriers until Sept. 21.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hotchkiss and Andrews boarded a private plane of PAL president Ramon Ang and flew to Zamboanga for an assessment of the situation and consulatationw with the Crisis Committee in the area ? co-chaired by Interior Secretary Mar Roxas and Zamboanga City Mayor Beng Climaco. \n\nWith a handle on the security situation, Hotchkiss conferred with airline representatives in the area and made arrangements for reopening the airport and resumption of commercial flights. \n\nAndrews said airline passengers would be allowed to carry only one hand-carried luggage during the intial flights to the beleaguered city. \"We would like to request passengers on the special flights on September 19, 2013 to please bring only one carry-on bag (up to 7 kilos), to check in at the airport early, and to cooperate with the special security procedures at the airport,\" Cebu Pacific said Wednesday. \n\nCebu Pacificalso \n\nsaid it would contact guests originally booked on Manila-Zamboanga-Manila flights on September 19 for their preferred option. \n\nTheir options include: \n\n- taking the flight on September 19 - rebooking - getting a full refund or travel fund - rerouting - proceeding with previously rebooked or cancelled flight. \n\nIn the meantime, the budget carrier sought the patience of passengers on other Zamboanga flights, since it is allowed to operate only one flight on Thursday. \n\nEarly Wednesday, Philippine National Police deputy director for operations Felipe Rojas Jr. said in Zamboanga City, believed to be the base from where Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) commander Habier Malik was holed up.\n\nGovernment forces have retaken as much as 80 percent of MNLF-controlled areas in the city, Rojas said. ?Danessa Rivera/KG/VS/ELR, GMA News",

        "title": "Irish Soda Scones and Relishing Cabbage",
        "content": "I am back with more cabbage recipes! Woo Hoo! But, honestly, this is one you are going to want to earmark and revisit often and remember fondly. This is one to make in bulk and jar for posterity. Really! I can't believe I didn't think of doing this sooner and its a ridiculously simple recipe too. Oh on the inventory update, the number of heads awaiting their tasty fates has reduced to ONE! So that's three consumed over the last three weeks. Yeah! I have been on a roll!\nThe thing is once you make the relish, you will start impatiently thinking of ways to use it. Hot dogs and burgers come easily to mind. On the same line, wraps, which, I also made. Then on a persistent foot tapping Sunday, I decided I wanted to eat the relish in the morning. Oh wait! That's brunch time. Hmmm... It was also time to bake some bread. Hmmm... Wham! Scones! Two and Two added nicely to Five. Don't you love when these things happen, in hindsight, very fluidly! The reality is that the relish had been staring at me from the counter for a couple of days. After a few days of putting it on top of everything, it seemed to be feeling forlorn in being ignored for two days. I don't like being stared with doe eyes. My heart melts in spite of me. I had to spoon into the jar again. Sometime in the last few days, Rosa tweeted about this cool recipe for a scone pastry shell. It was all there brewing in some compartment of my brain. Somehow they seemed gone around networking inside my mind shook each other's hands and decided it was time my conscious was enlightened. So, that's how it came to be. Except, oh wait! I had no butter! I was embarrassed, shocked, completely floored! What?! No butter! How ever did such blasphemy come to pass. Combined with an sudden inertia to not go to the store, I resorted to more (ahem!) creativity.\nI could bake a soda bread, like this one, but I could make it not so much bread but scones? I won't need butter. I love the flavors. It will be different. Plus, there is also thing Ireland has with cabbage. I don't know if you can call it love, but, it is prolific. So... Yeah! Let's do it.\nSo, well, that's the story peeps! ;)\nOnce I had a plan, it all came together nicely with things that I had (really, only the butter was missing!) on hand. Farm fresh yellow squashes, an Amish made smoked cheddar, Thursday laid eggs and oodles of that relish finished off with a lovely tang of grainy mustard. Oh yes! That was a good Sunday! :)\nIrish Soda Scones\n3 cups whole wheat flour\n3 T sugar\n1/4 cup raisins or dried cranberries or other dried fruit\n1 heaping tsp cream of tartar\n1 mildly heaping spoon baking soda\n1/2 tsp salt\n1-1/2 T olive oil\n1 egg\nabout 3/4 cup buttermilk\nPreheat oven to 400F.\nCombine all the dry ingredients together. Pour in the oil and egg. Add half cup of buttermilk and attempt to bring together the dough. If it is too dry, add more buttermilk a little at a time till the dough come together and very slightly sticky.\nWash hands and prepare a baking tray by sifting some flour on to it to prevent the bread from sticking. Flour your hands lightly and divide the dough into equal portions. Place on tray and give it a light pat. Score a cross atop each scone piece.\nBake for 20 or so minutes until the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\nSmoked Cabbage Relish\n2 heads cabbage, shredded\n1 T olive oil\n2 tsp smoked paprika (or more on how smoky you want it)\nany herbs you like\nsalt and pepper to taste\nPreheat oven to 350F.\nIn a roasting pan or other baking dish, combine all the ingredients together making sure that the seasoning spreads evenly. Cover with foil and bake for about 40 minutes until the cabbage is soft and flavorful. At about the 20 and 30 marks, gently lift the foil to give the stuff a stir so it evenly cooks.\nLet it cool. Place in jars and refrigerate.",

As His disciples, Jesus chooses men who have not been trained in any sacred school, most of whom are unlearned and illiterate, considered by the various religious groups within Judaism as 'people of the land,' or peasants.†† At Pentecost these men will be revealed to be the wisest of all, by the power of the Holy Spirit.\"† Some of these men, it is suggested by other Gospels, Jesus has known before; it may be the second time He has called some of them.† Peter, and James and John Zebedee, will form Jesus' inner circle of disciples, present at several notable events in the Gospels.\nAnd Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people.† Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.† Great multitudes followed Him -- from Galilee, and from Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.† \"This is a summary,\" says my study bible, \"of Jesus' early activity:† His miracles bear witness to the presence of the Kingdom (12:28) and serve as introduction to the Sermon on the Mount.\" Decapolis is a region of ten Greek-speaking cities located north and east of Galilee.† The great multitudes who follow come from all over Israel and Jewish territory.\nJesus' ministry begins, and is summed up in a few short verses.† It's interesting that the Gospels do not spend a lot of time on the choosing of the disciples.† Our impression is one of an immediate calling and following.† But it seems quite probable that Jesus knew several of these men (particularly John and James Zebedee) for a longer period than indicated -- before His public ministry; it's also implicated elsewhere that several disciples were first disciples of John the Baptist, who directed his disciples to Jesus.† Nevertheless, the impression of a kind of immediate selection and acceptance is interesting and, I feel, important.† There is not a lot of time spent wrangling over choices, agonizing over various individuals and relationships, or questioning the wisdom of this choice to choose or to follow.† I think what's important here is the trust in God that is implied, the surety of desire and intention, the faith in God's plan at work for the kingdom.† We know that one of His chosen will betray Him; nevertheless, this is the way things will unfold.† The Gospel presents these events in a very quick fashion in terms of the unfolding of His ministry, and again we are given the sense of a plan unfolding.† The several times we will hear of Jesus withdrawing for prayer or for discussion with His disciples come at several points in His ministry which we could call points of expansion, or key new points of unfolding of this ministry.† We know, also, that Jesus has been \"thrown by the Spirit\" for forty days of fasting and temptation in the wilderness as He began His ministry -- an important indication of just what type of preparation is really necessary for Christ.† Again, the whole implication of this type of pondering or contemplation (if we could call it that) implies trust in God.† At each new turning point, it is to prayer Jesus will turn.† And I think that for today the Gospel teaches us this very important point.† In our lives it's important to proceed with all due diligence, but it's really important to keep things in perspective, in the same sense that Jesus does.† There is a trust in God, a turning to prayer as preparation before each new turning point in the ministry, a reliance on the Father for guidance and for the unfolding of a plan.† We know what that plan holds for Jesus, and we know the fruits of this ministry in the world!† Let us understand what effectiveness is through the ranking of priorities here.† We put first our trust in God, and all else follows.† We trust in prayer.† And we put things in the hands of God.† We can't control everything ourselves, but we can trust to prayer.† We don't all have the same role to fill that Christ did; we are not each of us the Messiah.† But we can live the way He did, and learn from Him.† None of us has His power, but neither did He attempt to control all that happened in the world, or even the actions of all of His disciples when He was betrayed.† Let us remember we have far less power, and less capacity for control.† Let us start our journeys with prayer, our turning points with this trust and preparation, so that we may move forward as He did.† In this way, we may \"Follow Him\" as well.",

        "title": "Former GOP Chairman of Minnesota Files Bankruptcy",
        "content": "September 18th, 2013 by Reed Allmand Tony Sutton, 46, former chairman of the Minnesota GOP has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. †Along with his wife Bridget, the couple claims to have outstanding liabilities totaling over $2 million. †During his political career as state Republican Party chairman, Sutton pushed aggressively for republican legislators to stay in line with spending based on state revenue. †In other words, he was against any tax increases that would cause state legislators to go over budget. Yet, finances under his watch politically were no better than his finances personally. Sutton?s wife is a former Republican operative and currently is a school board member at a local high school. †When the couple filed bankruptcy they claimed they didn?t have health or life insurance. †Their debt liabilities include a wide range of creditors including unpaid federal student loans and federal and state taxes. †They owe hundreds of thousands of dollars toward personal unsecured loans they took out to help cover expenses related to their business. Sutton has a significant history as a Republican Party member having held practically every position you can think of over the last 20 years including executive director and treasurer. †Later, it was learned that Sutton had outspent the party?s funds. †This affected a ballot recount of a political official during a 2010 election and it caused Sutton to stop making payments on the rental space for the party?s headquarters which totaled over $100,000. By 2011, there was more evidence Sutton mismanaged funds, which accumulated more debt for the party. He then resigned his position abruptly. As more debt accumulated the party lost big donors. The party has had to cut staffers and spending in order to deal with the debt. The Suttons owe more than $70,000 in credit card debt, $20,000 in federal student loans and $80,000 on a second mortgage. They have over 15 businesses registered at their home address. †The couple is currently in the middle of divorce proceedings.

        "title": "Report: Secure electronic signatures on petitions are feasible",
        "content": "A secure system could be implemented that would allow voters to sign petitions online, an elections official told members of the Utah Legislature?s Government Operations Interim Committee on Wednesday.\n\n\"We believe the technology exists to allow this to happen,\" said Mark Thomas, chief deputy/director of elections in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nSecurity measures could include requiring voters to register to sign petitions online and issuing them a PIN number, he said.\n\nThomas, who presented a report on the issue, stressed that the lieutenant governor believes that whether citizens should be able to sign petitions online is a policy decision for the Legislature and that the office has no recommendation.\n\nLegislators passed a bill last year requiring the office to study a way that registered voters could receive information about petitions and sign them online. Their action came after the submission of electronic signatures in 2010 by Farley Anderson on his petition to qualify for the ballot as an unaffiliated gubernatorial candidate and a 2011 effort by Utahns for Ethical Government to put an initiative on the ballot that included some online signatures.\n\nThe Utah Supreme Court ruled that electronic signatures can be used in unaffiliated candidate petitions but did not address whether they could be used in initiatives. In 2011, the Utah lawmakers approved legislation prohibiting the use of electronic signatures in petitions.\n\nThomas also told the committee Wednesday that the state sent out postcards for the first time last year telling residents where they could find a voter information guide online. Recipients were given the option of requesting that a paper copy of the 80-page guide be mailed to them.\n\nThe office received about 25,000 requests for a paper copy, Thomas said, and got approximately 800,000 hits on its website in the days leading up to the 2012 general election. The estimated cost to provide a voter guide was $390,000 in 2010 and $170,000 in 2012, he said.\n\nIn comments about another voting issue, Thomas said he is working with the University of Utah, Brigham Young University and Utah State University to put together a report to be issued next year on mail-only elections. He said the turnout increased in jurisdictions that held vote-by-mail elections, including Duchesne County.\n\npmanson@sltrib.com\n\nTwitter: @PamelaMansonSLC",

        "content": "My wife and I are in the process of turning a former next-to-the-wall bathtub into a tub/shower. \n \nSo far we have torn out the drywall on the three walls surrounding the tub, put in a vinyl moisture barrier, and covered the area where we pulled out the drywall with Hardiebacker. \n \nWhat do we do from here? We didn't cut the drywall away perfectly so in some places there is anywhere from a 1/16\" to a 1/4\" gap between the Hardiebacker and the drywall. There are also small gaps between pieces of Hariebacker. \n \nSome websites talk about filling it in with modified thinset and some kind of tape, others don't mention the tape, and still others skip this step completely. \n \nWe're kind of lost as to how to proceed from here, and neither of us has really done any kind of significant home projects before. Detailed steps on what to do from here would be really appreciated!",

        "title": "Identify this old barn wood ?",
        "content": "So, I'm getting ready to tear down an old barn on my property, curious about what type of wood is in here and whether it's worth salvaging what little good wood remains.  \"Good\" meaning not rotted or split or full of termite damage. \n \nNot sure when this structure was built.  The home was built around 1890-1900, I think the barn was added years later.  it is 25x40'  The construction is sortof like half framed construction and half pole-barn.  There is a concrete footer with 2x6 bottom plate, but no studs, just 4x6 posts every 8 feet or so, horizontal 2x10 girts on the bottom, waist-height and at top of the walls, and a 2x6 top plate.  The walls are covered with 1x12 boards in 8' lengths, either with two 4' boards stacked on end or a single 8' board.  There is also galvanized steel siding over the boards, but I think that was added sometime long after it was built, in an attempt to cover the badly weathered siding. \n \nRoof is nothing more than 2x4's running at roughly 12/12 pitch to a peak at the top.  No trusses, no other supporting members of any kind. \n \nI busted one of the 1x12 siding pieces with a hammer, part of one of this board is below.  It breaks fairly easily, and has a very sweet smell to the broken ends, alot like pine but not quite.  It is light reddish-brown in color.  I don't have a planer so I just made a 45-degree cut to expose the grain.",

The lumber yard I'm getting the materials from sells 2x4's between 6 and 20 feet long. I had the thought that I could use 16 foot rails, staggered so posts have alternating mid-points and ends attached to the faces. Seems like it would be stronger to me and allow more secure attachment to posts. Are there any reasons not to do this? The guy at the lumber yard hasn't ever heard of that and wasn't sure... Should I just do 8 foot 2x4's throughout? \n \nHaven't been able to find an answer to this question after fairly extensive searching, hopefully I explained it somewhat clearly!",

        "title": "Back in the Kitchen: Patch Readers Share Go-To Weekend Breakfast Recipes",
        "content": "When I was a new mom, I had images of laid-back weekend mornings cooking elaborate breakfasts of? bacon, eggs, fresh-squeezed juice, the works.? Perhaps even chucking the little one?s nose with a bit of homemade pancake batter while they cutely (and neatly, ha ha) whisked away at my side. So homey! So...virtuous!? So...not happening.Now I just pray everyone will sleep really late. Weekend mode means? keep the cold cereal in an obvious spot on the counter and hold the belief six is plenty old enough to pour your own milk. (She?s quite handy, that kid.)? But I still have days where images of motherly perfection creep back in, especially once September comes. I want to get back into the kitchen. And breakfast feels like the right gateway back in after a summer of outdoor grilling.? Curious if I was alone in my autumnal return to the hearth, I asked Patch readers for their ideas.? Per usual, you all? are an? amazing and generous bunch:? Stephanie West Stellwagen and Lauren Ayres of Greenwich CT both decided to take on? the humble egg:? Lauren gives us a decadent frittata that also manages to use up leftovers? (score!) while Stephanie goes a little lighter with egg whites and almond milk.? Laura Crosbie of Hazlet, NJ? shares her? \"Cupcake Omelets.\" They freeze great and? can take you right into the work week.? ? And what would a recipe round-up be without Nutella? For that we can thank Amanda Bloodgood, also of New Jersey, by way of Freehold and Jackson.? We're no test cooks though?that's where you come in! Test it, try it and tweak it your way. Just be sure to share your recipes, tips, tricks and photos back.? ? PatchCooks is? a new nationally crowd-sourced feature that gathers favorite? recipes from Patch readers coast to coast each week on a particular theme.? This week's theme was \"weekend breakfast\"?delicious things you love to make when you have a little extra time.? Next week's theme: Ridiculously easy weeknight dinners, emphasis on \"I can make that? with three hungry kids hanging all over me, easy.\"? ? What's your go-to recipe? Use? #patchcooks on Twitter or email kathleen@patch.com.",

One starter will be dropped, since the Game 1 starter can start in Game 5. \n\nMore immediately, the club has yet to announce its rotation beyond this weekend. With an off-day next Monday and Thursday, the starters for the two games in Denver have yet to be determined. In the last series of the season in Baltimore, Jon Lester, John Lackey and Clay Buchholz will pitch in some order. One of those three will be the Game 1 starter. Farrell said he has thoughts about who that Game 1 starter will be but that internal discussions have yet to be conducted on finalizing the postseason rotation order. \n\nCenter fielderr Jacoby Ellsbury spoke about his condition and offered that he and doctors are \"confident'' and \"hopeful'' he will be able to be ready by the postseason, perhaps even before the regular season is over. Said Farrell: \"We're all envisioning him being back on the field before the regular season is completed.''",

        "title": "UAB to host photographer Bob Adelman for lecture, exhibition of 1963 Children's March",
        "content": "/Post Comments \n\nBIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Photographer Bob Adelman, an eyewitness to the Children's Crusade of May, 1963, will return to Birmingham on Thursday, Sept. 26, to exhibit 38 photographs and to talk about his experiences during the march. \n\nAdelman, at the time a volunteer photographer for the Congress of Racial Equality, was documenting the April 1963 Postman's March in Tennessee and Georgia when he got word that something was being organized in Birmingham. \n\n?I went from the Georgia border ? I think I hitched a ride,? Adelman said this week by phone from Florida. ?I was a volunteer and didn't have press credentials or much money.? \n\nHe arrived at the A.G. Gaston Motel, where several CORE workers were staying. He eventually gained credentials and access to civil rights figures such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, James Baldwin and James Bevel, even having breakfast one morning with singer Joan Baez. \n\nThe night before the march, Adelman went to Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, where plans were being made. \n\n?The children were mostly downstairs and they were deciding to march,? he recalled. ?The parents initially were opposed to them marching. Nobody wants their children going to jail. But most of the young people were eager. They understood exactly what it all meant. They wanted to be unleashed.? \n\nAs more than 1,000 children gathered the following morning and the march started, Adelman started taking pictures as they boarded buses, marched in the streets and endured fire hoses while locking outstretched arms. Several images eventually made their way to the covers of Esquire, Time, People, Life, New York Times magazine, Paris Match and London Times magazine. \n\nThey are the focus of ?Bob Adelman: The Children's March,? which opens with a lecture by Adelman on Sept. 26 at UAB's Hulsey Recital Hall, 950 13th St. South. The exhibition will be shown Friday, Sept. 27 through Thursday, Oct. 31 at the UAB Visual Arts Gallery, 900 13th St. South. \n\nAdelman, a Guggenheim Fellow, has lectured about photography at several museums and universities, including Columbia, Stanford, Minnesota, Ohio State and Miami, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Although many of his recollections of the Children's Crusade are captured in the photographs, others remain hidden from view. \n\n?Going outside the motel and into what was going on, the police had cordoned off the black area around Kelly Ingram Park,? he said. ?If you were a white person living downtown, you hardly knew there was anything going on. There weren't many blacks in the stores, and there wasn't anything in the papers about it. That was the tactic. Bull Connor just politely arrested people. Outside of Loveman's, some picketers would assert themselves into the downtown area, and when they went into the store they were quickly arrested.? \n\nThe police were in control, recalled Adelman, putting young people in jail and being orderly about it. The youths, however, saw that the situation had its limits. \n\n?At some point it dawned on them that the police couldn't continue to do this because they ran out of space.  The children were happy going to jail because they knew they were playing a joke on the police. They were pacifists, with a Gandhian ideal to fill the jails and immobilize police.? \n\nBut the white glove treatment, as Adelman called it, soon ended. \n\n?Bull Connor lost his cool and they brought out the dogs and the hoses. It was a truly shocking experience. I have never seen people treated so badly. There was as much water behind my camera as there was in front of it. I was terrified.? \n\nAdelman was only in Birmingham for a few days, but his visit left indelible impressions ? on his memory and on black and white film. \n\n?I couldn't afford to stay,? he said. ?But I came to very much admire the young children of Birmingham. They were extraordinary. I'm looking forward to meeting some of them.?",

        "content": "By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatch \n\nSAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Technology stocks put in strong gains Wednesday, led by advances by bellwethers Adobe Systems Inc. and Apple Inc., and a historic day for Priceline.com Inc. \n\nAdobe (ADBE) surged more than 9%, to close at $52.58, a day after the software company reported a steady growth in its subscriber base, a trend that has won upbeat reviews from analysts. \n\nApple (AAPL) shares tacked on 2%, to close at $464.68, as The Cupertino, Calif.-based company released iOS 7, the latest version of its iPhone and iPad operating system. Apple will begin selling its new iPhone in retail stores on Friday. \n\nPriceline (PCLN) continued its yearlong hot streak, and made history by becoming the first S&P 500 (SPX) listed company to have its shares top the $1,000 mark. Priceline's stock peaked at $1,001 before falling at $995.09 a share. \n\nFacebook Inc. (FB) came back from early losses to rise 16 cents and close at $45.23 a share. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who has an outperform rating on the social network's stock, raised his price target to $49 from $39. \"Strong mobile growth should continue for the foreseeable future, supplemented by monetization of Instagram,\" he said in a note. \"Facebook now has more daily active users on mobile than on desktop and it expects to generate more revenue on mobile than on desktop in the near future.\" Shares of BlackBerry (RIMM) slipped 1.5%, to close at $10.40, on a report from The Wall Street Journal that it was planning to cut up to 40% of its workforce. \n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index (RIXF) ended the day up by almost 38 points, or 1%, at 3,783. The Morgan Stanley High Tech 35 Index(MSH) rose 1.5%, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gained almost 1%. \n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires",

        "title": "Man sentenced for killing BYU professor regains his right to appeal",
        "content": "Nearly two years after he was sentenced to spend at least 25 years behind bars for the brutal murder of a Brigham Young University professor, Benjamin Rettig?s right to appeal the sentence is being reinstated.\n\nIn April, Rettig asked 4th District Judge Thomas Low to reinstate his appeal rights, according to court records, claiming that he was not advised of his right to appeal the sentence of 25 years to life in prison before the time limit for an appeal expired. He said in his handwritten motion that his previous bid to the Utah Court of Appeals was denied because it was filed too late, which he blamed on his attorney.\n\nOn Tuesday, Low ? the judge who handed down the prison sentence to Rettig in December 2011 ? ruled the Rettig was deprived of his right to appeal, finding that Rettig did attempt to invoke his appeal right on Jan. 6, which was a week before the time limit expired. However, his request was not officially filed with the court until after that 30-day window had ended.\n\nRettig will now have 30 days to file an appeal with the Utah Court of Appeals. The basis for his proposed appeal has not been discussed in district court documents.\n\nRettig accepted a plea deal in June 2011 and pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and aggravated kidnapping for the 2009 slaying of Kay Mortensen. As part of his plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to ask the judge for life with the possibility of parole. \n\nRettig is asking to appeal only his sentencing, so if he wins the appeal, he will not change his plea, but rather, would be re-sentenced. But if he is re-sentenced, prosecutors could ask for a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, since Rettig failed to hold up his end of the plea agreement when he refused to testify against codefendant Martin Cameron Bond at Bond?s trial.\n\nIn January, a jury found Bond, 26, guilty of aggravated murder, three counts of aggravated kidnapping and one count each of aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery. Low sentenced Bond to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nAccording to court documents, Rettig and Bond broke into Mortensen?s Payson Canyon home the night of Nov. 16, 2009, to steal the man?s extensive gun collection. During the burglary, Rettig trained a handgun on Mortensen as Bond slashed the 70-year-old man?s throat with a knife, prosecutors said.\n\nRettig also helped tie up Mortensen?s son and daughter-in-law, Roger and Pamela Mortensen, who happened to come to the house during the burglary.\n\nThe couple spent roughly eight months in jail facing murder charges for the slaying before a tipster led police to Bond and Rettig.\n\nRettig was recently charged with obstruction of justice for refusing to testify at Bond?s trial. He will appear in court on Sept. 26 for a scheduling hearing in that case.\n\njmiller@sltrib.com\n\nTwitter: @jm_miller",

        "title": "Republican lawmakers renew Benghazi criticisms at hearing",
        "content": "By Patricia Zengerle \n \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers accused the State Department of failing to hold anyone accountable for the Benghazi attacks at a hearing on Wednesday, the first of three this week in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives on the 2012 incident. \n \n\"No State Department personnel have been fired or even disciplined. No one has missed a paycheck,\" said Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who called the hearing. \n \nBut Patrick Kennedy, the undersecretary of state for management and the hearing's only witness, said four State employees were relieved of high-level positions. \n \nRepublicans and Democrats have been waging a political battle over Benghazi since militants linked to al Qaeda affiliates attacked U.S. diplomatic outposts and killed Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and three other Americans just over a year ago. \n \nRepublicans say the attacks exposed security lapses that must be addressed. Some also accuse Democrats of a cover-up to protect President Barack Obama as he ran for re-election, and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, considered a leading 2016 Democratic presidential candidate. \n \nDemocrats contend the incident was the type of tragedy that happens in a dangerous world. They say House Republicans are spending time and energy on Benghazi while ignoring issues like legislation to prevent a pending government shutdown. \n \nRepresentative Darrell Issa, a Republican and chairman of the House Oversight committee, said on Fox News on Wednesday he may call Clinton back to Washington to testify on Benghazi. \n \nIssa's committee and a House Armed Services panel will hold separate Benghazi-related hearings on Thursday. \n \nAt Wednesday's hearing, several Republicans charged that the administration disregards the safety of U.S. personnel, while some Democrats made their skepticism about the hearing's purpose clear. \n \n\"I'd like to ask some questions about Benghazi, the scandal that never was,\" Florida Democrat Alan Grayson said. \n \n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Vicki Allen)",

        "content": "An excerpt from Aaron Schinke?s presentation at AutoCon 2013, September 4-6 at Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. † Want to get your hands on the full PowerPoint? † Just ask† HERE ! \n \nAaron Schinke kills it with more than content at AutoCon 2013 \n \nIt?s unanimous. As confirmed by Google, one of the most important things you can do for you brand and its digital presence is produce high quality, unique content. But what does that even mean? It?s more than hyperbole ? but it also deserves more than just lip service. \n \nThe purpose of content marketing is to attract and retain customers by consistently creating and curating relevant and valuable content with the intention of changing or enhancing consumer behavior. It is an ongoing process that is best integrated into your overall marketing strategy, and it focuses on owning media, not renting it. \n \nHuh? \n \nThe secret here is to just get started. \n \nBut people don?t like to read! \n \nReally? While ereader sales are down from its peak in 2011, providers continue to invest in tablet improvements for an expected 11.7 million dollars in sales as late into the future as 2017. \n \nBut buyers only use 3rd party websites for consumer research! \n \nReally? According to Google, 83% of consumers use a dealership?s direct website as the main source of research information when shopping for a car. †This is a fact supported by recent case studies and research released by top 3rd party lead aggregators themselves! \n \nBut I have nothing to write about! \n \nWell?you?ve got us there. †The task of creating unique and compelling content is one that challenges even the best hypothesis theorists in history; tests even the most proven algorithms. †Otherwise, we?d be out of work! \n \nNot really. \n \nGoogle provides tools to find keywords and plan content around real topics consumers are searching NOW! †Real-time analytics provide further insights into what?s working and how to adjust your strategy. \n \nOk. Now where do I post it? \n \nBlogs and forums are everywhere, but focusing on those that are top in your industry and get picked up most by Google will be your best bet. WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr are good examples. Next up? Professionally written press releases, custom landing pages and microsites . \n \nHave a personality. One of our top converting pieces compared a used 2006 Ford Econoline Cargo Van in Kansas to a blank canvas to an artist possible of transporting large exotic animals and the world?s largest Pog collection. Boom. Sold. \n \nBe sharable. The DealerFire Employment Page calls for a new Content Specialist to the join the team by making it clear it is looking for the next Bill Shakespeare capable of making a Ford Pinto sound like a Cadillac with nothing more than their poetic skills. Boom. More resumes than we can handle. \n \nYou have the immediate opportunity to be found during your customer?s shopping experience. If you do it right, you?ll be right where your consumer is when they go to look for information. \n \nPutting time and effort into content for your dealership is paramount to its success, but you need to do more than a 3rd party to copy and paste some awful blogs for you. Your entire dealership (and website) is a content hub waiting to be unleashed. Put your site to work for you right now ? and even have fun while doing it! \n \nWant to get your hands on Aaron?s full PowerPoint presentation deck? †Just ask HERE ! \n \nThe post How to Kill It with Content: Writing Off  Your Competition appeared first on DealerFire .",

This award celebrated in recognition of the pivotal role that Speaker Tip ONeill played for Ireland on a worldwide stage and the work that he undertook for Irelands benefit. It also recognize the work of our present day Diaspora.\n\nThis award is a partnership initiative of Buncrana Town Council and Donegal County Council. Michael Heaney, Director of Service at Donegal County Council said This is an important event for Donegal. Not only does it honor one of the most esteemed members of the Donegal Diaspora in perpetuity, but also recognizes and celebrates the work of a current member of the present day Diaspora. The Donegal Diaspora Project is a key initiative of the Donegal County Development Board and the Tip ONeill Irish Diaspora Award will over the years continue to play a vital role in reaching out to broad Irish Diaspora throughout the world. Seamus Neely, Donegal County Manager, said Donegal County Council is delighted to be part of this important project which is in recognition of the various key roles that our Diaspora continue to play both at home and abroad. We are delighted to have the involvement of members of the ONeill family from so many various parts of the United States and also look forward to welcoming Governor Brian Schweitzer and his family. According to the Mayor of Buncrana, Cllr. Peter McLaughlin Inishowen is full of excitement this week in anticipation of this upcoming event. The success of last year is still fresh in our memories and has inspired many people from the area. Cllr. Nicholas Crossan added This weekend is fast becoming very significant in Buncranas annual calendar of events and is a great opportunity for our people to connect in a very positive way with our living Diaspora as we all celebrate our shared heritage. Speaking from the US this week, Tommy ONeill, son of Tip ONeill expressed his excitement about the trip. It is a great honor to come back to Inishowen to participate in the Tip ONeill Irish Diaspora Award and the great festivities planned over the weekend. My fathers grandmother Eunice Fullerton was born outside Buncrana and his grandfather James Tolan was born in Clonmany so this part of the world still resonates as home for many of us. On Friday evening, the Tip ONeill Irish Diaspora Award ceremony will take place in the Inishowen Gateway Hotel and this award will be conferred to this years recipient, Governor Brian Schweitzer, by Minister of State, Dinny McGinley, TD. Governor Brian Schweitzer has strong Irish connections.",

        "content": "Tweet Most of us around here are big fans of looking on the bright side as much as possible, but we like to keep it real too! Sometimes stuff happens, and we need to be prepared for emergency situations. For most folks, a generator could go a long way to keep the lights on and food cold in the event of an outage, but they are pretty pricey. On eBay Deals, however, we have a few great generator offers, like this†DuroMax Elite Series MX4500E Generator†for†38% off. The 4,500 Watt†DuroMax Elite Series MX4500E Generator†is a top selling generator. It has loaded power panel that is the generator?s main control center; it features the RV Switch, volt meter, engine shutoff, and circuit breakers. Able to power a wide array of things around your home, business, garage, or RV, it can operate things like air compressors, home lighting, appliances, and air conditioners. I could go on about how awesome this generator is, but the listing for this†DuroMax Elite Series MX4500E Generator†does it for me. That?s why I?m going to talk about the price again! It?s only†$429.99, which is a lovely price for this sort of thing! Of course, the eBay Deals discount and final price tag are pretty nice, but the free shipping really seals the deal! † Note: While this deal is set to expire according to the clock above, the product may sell out before then.

        "content": "We knew our chances were slim as reviewers warned to make reservations in advance. \"Lines around the corner!\", they cautioned. \"Booking is imperative!\", they advised. We should have heeded their warning and were turned away. As we shuffled our feet very slowly out the door, shoulders slumped, head hanging low, a waiter bolted out (ok, more like walked, appreciate the dramatic effect), and jovially beckoned us back to the restaurant. I don't recall much of the meal except for the pork and kale meatballs which I hoped would somehow regenerate themselves after consumption. But they didn't. Which is probably a good thing. Maybe.† Anyway, can't wait to see you again Le Verre VolÈ. LE VERRE VOLE 67, rue de Lancry",

        "content": "While BlackBerry is rumoured to be pursuing a sale ? to be wrapped up as quickly as November ? and preparing another round of layoffs, the embattled Canadian titan is still releasing devices and plowing ahead with plans to roll out BBM to the iPhone and Android platforms. The once exclusively BlackBerry-only club will open its doors on 21 September and there is no cover charge ? BBM will be available as a free download in Google Play and the App Store.\nWhy would you leave the comfort of iOS 7?s swanky new messages app or your swiss-army knife of cross-platform chat apps, WhatsApp for BBM? Well, despite the noise about its parent company?s struggles, BBM is a pretty unique network. BBM conversations run on a type of enclave on the net and it uses a PIN so you don?t have to give anyone your phone number or email address.\nThe traditional file sharing features are there for photos and voice notes, but there are other things like BBM Groups that lets you invite up to 30 friends to chat together, and goes a step further than multi-chat by allowing you to share photos and schedules. And, with Broadcast Message, you can send a message out to all your BBM contacts at once.\nBBM has always been considered more of a social network than a run of the mill chat app. It lets you post a personal message, profile picture and your current status, and lets your contacts know via updates.\nBBM will be available as a free download for Android smartphones running Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean (Android 4.x) beginning at 7AM EDT on 21 September.\nBBM for iPhones running iOS 6 and iOS 7 will become available for each market on the App Store schedule of 12:01 AM local time on September 22.\nLater this year, BBM will be updated with ?Channels?. A channel is a type of mini social network or forum where you can engage with your friends or other communities about the things you?re passionate about. Subscribing to a Channel will let you join conversations with people who share your interests.\nBBM Video calling and BBM Voice calling remain a BlackBerry-exclusive features for now, but are planned for availability for Android and iPhone at some point.\nFollow @memeburn\n†email article †print article\nBurning hot\nBlackBerry looking for buyers as it runs out of options\nGoogle finally brings out tool to help you find your lost Android\nJellyBean continues its rise, now running on 45% of Android devices\nThe iPhone 5C was never meant for China, or any other emerging market\n[ advertising enquiries ] Related articlesBlackBerry services down for Vodafone users in Europe, Middle East, AfricaFree voice calls over Wi Fi comes to BBM in betaCan you use BBM to fight pollution?

News, the actor was spotted playing tonsil hockey with singer-actress Eiza Gonzalez at her apartment complex in Beverly Hills on Tuesday, just a few days they were spotted together in Las Vegas and right after it was confirmed he and Miley Cyrus broke off their 15-month engagement.\n\nHe definitely traded up.\n\nWhile a source told the website Hemsworth and Gonzalez \"just met,\" it appears they like each other. \n\nBecause we all care, E! reported that Hemsworth stopped by Gonzalez's place around 3:30 p.m. to give her a piece of luggage. He was only there for about five minutes, which apparently was long enough to get pictures of them trying to resuscitate each other.\n\nGonzalez apparently recently moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting opportunities. \n\nA source told E! that Gonzalez, who broke up with her boyfriend of two years earlier this summer, is reportedly due in Mexico on Friday for an appearance at the DVD release of the Spanish-language version of Disney's \"The Croods.\"\n\nContact Tony Hicks at",

        "content": "PORTAFERRY RNLI rescued a fisherman from the sea this afternoon after his vessel sank off the County Down coast. \n\nThe volunteer lifeboat crew responded to a Mayday call following a request from the Coastguard to go to the aid of a man aboard a fishing boat that was reported to be sinking fast. The call was received at 12.30pm and the crew launched the Blue Peter V, the station's Atlantic 85 inshore class lifeboat at 12.40pm. They were called to an area close to Butter Pladdy, about three miles north east of Strangford Bar, just off Kearney Point. \n\nThe lifeboat arrived on the scene at 1.04pm, by which time the 7.1m fishing boat had sunk. The lifeboat crew began a search for the man who had been on board. Weather conditions presented rough seas, with force five to six winds blowing and good visibility. The crew located the fisherman at 1.15pm, when a member of the lifeboat crew entered the sea to assist the casualty into the lifeboat. \n\nOnce both the casualty and lifeboat crew member were safely on board the lifeboat, the casualty was administered first aid and his condition assessed. \n\nAlso on scene were Donaghadee RNLI and the Irish Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116 and the casualty was subsequently winched into the helicopter from the lifeboat and flown directly to Musgrave Park Hospital in Belfast for treatment. \n\nSpeaking following the rescue, Leonard Lawson, Portaferry RNLI Deputy Launching Authority, said: \"It is at times like this that the quick response of our volunteer crew members combined with their training and skill, saves lives at sea. The lifeboat was launched within minutes and thankfully the casualty was located shortly after the crew arrived on the scene. The rescue of this man was undoubtedly helped by the fact that he was wearing his lifejacket.\"",

        "title": "San Jose State introduces new women's basketball coach",
        "content": "SAN JOSE -- Jamie Craighead had to make a tough decision, but is excited about the opportunity to take over as the new women's basketball coach at San Jose State.\n\nCraighead left her perch at Sacramento State on Monday to take over the vacancy at SJSU created by the resignation of Tim La Kose. Her hiring comes less than two weeks before the start of practice.\n\n\"Obviously it was really difficult, just like I'm sure it was difficult for the previous coach here,\" Craighead said Wednesday of leaving Sac State. \"You invest in your players lives if you're good at what you do. It's not a business when it comes to them. But there are times when you have to make decisions and put yourself forward. I think as coaches, we tend to be selfless and put our kids in front of our own needs. But this decision was the right one for me.\"\n\nCraighead praised the vision of the athletic department. She got good feedback about the program from Boise State coach Gordy Presnell, who she coached under at Seattle Pacific and worked with Bleymaier in Boise.\n\n\"He thinks this program has a chance to be great,\" Craighead said of Presnell \"It didn't take much convincing. I believe it's a great opportunity. I could see that right away.\"\n\nCraighead's next step is to meet the team and begin filling her staff. She wouldn't say if any of the current SJSU assistants are expected to stay on or if any of her Sacramento State staff would join her in San Jose.\n\n\"It's open at this point and we'll see who joins me,\" Craighead said.\n\nCraighead counts Presnell as one of the major influences in her coaching career, along with Loyola Marymount coach Charity Elliott and Dan Muscatell, who was an assistant during Craighead's playing days at Oregon, was her predecessor at Sacramento State and is again an assistant at Oregon.\n\n\"I've always wanted to be a coach at this level,\" Craighead said. \"I feel like my playing experience gave me a lot of great tools as well as I've had a lot of great mentors along my path. I've really enjoyed this profession and it's a long-term life for me.\"\n\nFollow Jimmy Durkin at Twitter.com/Jimmy_Durkin.",

        "content": "SOURCE Kenwood Vineyards\n\nKENWOOD (SONOMA VALLEY), Calif., Sept. 18, 2013 \n\nDeeply colored, the 2009 Kenwood Vineyards Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon captivates with sumptuous cassis, black raspberry, cedar and forest aromas. Powerful yet lithe flavors of cassis, blackberry, licorice and peppermint gain additional complexity from a subtle hint of earth. In the glass the aromas become fuller, with the flavors gaining depth, nuance and polish. The generous, seamless palate ? with weight, structure and balance in perfect harmony ? culminates in a long, elegant finish. While already approachable, the 2009 Kenwood Vineyards Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon promises additional evolution with cellaring. \n\nWith a cool, dry spring and moderate temperatures during summer and autumn that brought the smaller-than-average Cabernet Sauvignon crop to full maturity, the 2009 growing season was nearly perfect in Sonoma County. As a result, Kenwood harvested grapes with impressive fruit and balance for the 2009 Artist Series primarily from its estate vineyard in Sonoma Valley, with additional grapes coming from outstanding vineyards in Dry Creek Valley and Knights Valley. \n\nThe 2009 Kenwood Vineyards Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon label features the enticing \"THESTATEYOU'REIN,\" a vibrant contemporary piece of art by Markus Linnenbrink Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignons are always eagerly awaited and surely the 2009 Kenwood Vineyards Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon will join previous vintages as a coveted collectible. ? The 1016 cases of 750ml bottles this vintage produced are available in selected markets nationally at a suggested retail of $60 \n\nEstablished in 1970 in the Sonoma Valley, Kenwood Vineyards produces premium wines that showcase the world-class quality and character of Sonoma County vineyards.\n\nDiscover the art, savor the wine.\n\nArtist Series Video: http://youtu.be/vN00YTA0cDE\n\n? ?\n\nVideo with caption: \"Art has always been the focus of the Kenwood Vineyards Artist Series, and while the art by Markus Linnenbrink \n\nImage with caption: \"Art has always been the focus of the Kenwood Vineyards Artist Series, and while the art by Markus Linnenbrink",

        "content": "Imagine life without household brands like Huggies, Pull-Ups, Depend, Kleenex, Scott, and Cottenelle. Yeah ... not fun. Of course, other companies make similar products, but those companies haven't marketed their products as effectively as Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB \n\nEuropean strategic changes\n\nLike most international companies throughout all industries, Kimberly-Clark hasn't been? having a grand ole time in Europe over the past several years, especially in Western and Central Europe. Austerity measures have led to a weak consumer, which has affected Kimberly-Clark's performance.\n\nHowever, Kimberly-Clark has been around since 1872.? This focused strategy was implemented in Q2 2012, and it's expected to be completed by December 2014. During this time, Kimberly-Clark will reduce its headcount by 1,300-1,500 people. This is bad news for employees, but it's good news for investors. Labor is the biggest expense, and reducing headcount has the potential to significantly improve the bottom line, which pleases investors.\n\nAlso as a part of this strategy, Kimberly-Clark will close or sell five of its European manufacturing facilities and streamline its operations. Furthermore, Kimberly-Clark will focus more on stronger growth opportunities and divest its low-margin operations, especially in consumer tissue. Finally, aside from Italy, Kimberly-Clark will exit diapers in Western Europe and Central Europe.\n\nAs a separate strategy, as well as a way to keep investors happy, Kimberly-Clark plans to repurchase $1.2 billion worth of stock in 2013. This is in addition to Kimberly-Clark currently yielding 3.5%.\n\nRecent results\n\nSince Kimberly-Clark is in the midst of its \"European Strategic Changes\" strategy, let's see if any progress is being made.\n\nIn the second quarter, net sales came in at $5.3 billion, which matched the year-ago quarter. Selling prices increased, but unfavorable currency effects offset this trend.\n\nBelow is a quick look at net sales growth for each segment on a year-over-year basis: Considering such mixed results, it can be difficult to paint a clear picture. That's why guidance is important. Kimberly-Clark expects FY 2013 volume, price and mix growth of 3%-5%, mostly led by international operations.\n\nMore products you find in your home\n\nKimberly-Clark has been a hands-down winner over the long haul, but we must also consider some peers so we can increase our chances of making the best possible investment decision.\n\nFor instance, the following brand names are also well known: Schick, Edge, Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Wet Ones, Playtex, and Diaper Genie. These all fall under? Energizer (NYSE: ENR Kimberly-Clark, Energizer, and Johnson & Johnson all offer similar valuations, trading at 16, 13, and 15 times forward earnings, respectively. However, there are some differences in key metrics.? Kimberly-Clark turns the highest percentage of your investor dollars into profit (ROE), and it offers the highest yield. On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson turns the most revenue into profit (net margin), it offers a strong yield, it has displayed better debt management, and it has fewer people betting against it.? Kimberly-Clark and Johnson & Johnson have shown more revenue growth than Energizer over the past five years.? ? data by YCharts All three of these companies are likely to be long-term winners. However, Kimberly-Clark and Johnson & Johnson look to be slightly more impressive than Energizer at this point in time, with Johnson & Johnson being the most impressive of the bunch. In addition to Johnson & Johnson's strong fundamentals, it's also highly diversified, with operations in? Consumer, Pharmaceutical, and Medical Devices and Diagnostics.? ? The Foolish bottom line\n\nThe praise above for Johnson & Johnson isn't meant to take anything away from Kimberly-Clark. This is an extremely well-run company that has thrived during good times and shown resiliency during difficult times. Kimberly-Clark has a targeted strategy to improve weak areas, and if the stock suffers at any point, it's only likely to be a matter of time before it rebounds. These dips should give investors an opportunity to purchase more shares. Best of all, you will also be collecting generous dividend payments in the meantime.\n\nLooking for stable dividends?\n\nIf you're looking for some long-term investing ideas, you're invited to check out 's brand-new special report, \".\" It's absolutely free, so simply and get your copy today.\n\nDan Moskowitz has no position in any stocks mentioned. recommends Energizer Holdings, Johnson & Johnson, and Kimberly-Clark. owns shares of Johnson & Johnson.

        "content": "By Herbert Lash\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks soared and gold jumped while the dollar and bond prices fell sharply on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve surprised investors by keeping its economic stimulus in place on concerns tighter financial conditions could slow the economy.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 stock indexes shot to record highs after the U.S. central bank said it would continue buying bonds at an $85 billion monthly pace and wait for more evidence that economic progress can be sustained.\n\nGold, a traditional inflation hedge, soared more than 4 percent at one point and crude oil futures settled sharply higher as the Fed's move to leave its monetary stimulus program unchanged is largely seen as supporting commodity prices.\n\nInvestors had widely expected the Fed, whose policy-setting committee ended a two-day meeting on Wednesday, to begin to trim its bond buying program by about $10 billion a month.\n\n\"The initial reaction was positive, with people thinking, 'Here we go, more liquidity in the market.' That's a good thing as far as being an ongoing tailwind,\" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston, where he helps oversee $703 billion in assets under management.\n\n\"But the decision also means the economy isn't as strong as we'd like, which has implications for corporate earnings down the road. I don't think we'll settle up where we popped.\"\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said it would await evidence of a more stable economy before adjusting the pace of its asset purchases.\n\nThe Fed also downgraded its forecast for U.S. economic growth to a range of 2 to 2.3 percent this year, down from 2.3 to 2.6 percent in its June estimates. The downgrade for next year was even sharper.\n\nThe Dow and S&P closed at record highs, while the Nasdaq was at its highest since September 2000.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed up 147.21 points, or 0.95 percent, at 15,676.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX advanced 20.76 points, or 1.22 percent, at 1,725.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 37.94 points, or 1.01 percent, at 3,783.64.\n\nHEADS YOU WIN, TAILS YOU WIN\n\nThe market's reaction to the Fed's unexpected decision indicated stocks were in a bull market, said Ken Fisher, founder and chairman of Fisher Investments.\n\n\"Up until today, they expected the beginning of the end of quantitative easing and the market rose every day (this week) into that. That doesn't happen, and the market reacts positively anyway. What does that tell you? It's a bull market,\" he said.\n\n\"It likes it if it's heads, and it likes it if it's tails.\"\n\nAbout 580 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market hit new 52-week highs. About 325 stocks hit those highs after the Fed announcement.\n\nTrading was heavy, the biggest volume day since late June.\n\nPriceline.com Inc (PCLN.O: Quote, Profile, Research) shot to an intraday high of $1,001, the first company in S&P 500's history to surpass the thousand-dollar mark.\n\nShares in the online travel agency closed up 2.6 percent at $995.09.\n\nSpot gold rose as high as $1,366.39 an ounce, or about 4.3 percent on the day.\n\nU.S. Comex gold futures for December settled down $1.80 an ounce at $1,307.60 prior to the Fed statement.\n\nThe dollar fell to a seven-month low against the euro and yields on U.S. government debt dropped to their lowest in more than a month.\n\nThe dollar index fell as low as 80.203 .DXY, the lowest since mid-February. It was last at 80.088, down 1.3 percent.\n\nThe euro climbed to a seven-month peak of $1.3518 and last changed hands at $1.3516, up 1.19 percent.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve remains quite concerned about the overall sluggishness of the economy, preferring to take the risk of being too loose for too long as opposed to tighten prematurely,\" said Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer at Pimco in Newport Beach, California.\n\nThe Fed caught bond investors off guard. Investors had been pulling out of bond funds on expectations of higher yields, while others hedged bonds, mortgages and other fixed-income holdings vulnerable to a rate spike as the Fed looked set to begin the long road of withdrawing its stimulus.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes were last up 1-10/32 in price to yield 2.6951 percent, down from 2.86 percent before the statement. They fell as low as 2.673 percent, the lowest since August 13.\n\nBrent oil for November delivery settled $2.41 per barrel higher at $110.60. The previous session, Brent settled at a six-week low.\n\nU.S. crude for October delivery settled $2.65 per barrel higher at $108.07 a barrel after trading as high as $108.25.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Additional reporting by Marc Jones in London and Ryan Vlastelica in New York; Editing by James Dalgleish, Leslie Adler and Nick Zieminski)",

        "content": "Here are some suggestions on how to pick out the right jewel for your woman. \n \nUse a soft cloth on your jewelry as often as you want. This is an easy way to get shine without chemicals and solvents. Use the two-sided cloth to polish your jewelry as if you were cleaning glass. Use the side that is designated for polish, and the other to make it shine. \n  TIP! Your jewlery needs to be kept in a place where it is protected from air and humidity. Store them in a closed jewelry box or small drawstring bag for maximum protection.   \nUse a polishing cloth on your jewelry pieces. This method to maintain the appearance of your jewelry stays shiny without having to use any chemical cleansers or solvents. Use the dual-sided cloth to gently buff your jewelry as though you were cleaning glass. Use one side to shine it and the other for improving its shine. \n \nBe sure that you understand the kind of gemstone that is in the jewelry that you are purchasing. There are basically three distinct types: natural gems, synthetic gems and imitation stones. Synthetic and natural are real stones, while the imitation ones are plastic that is colored. Natural stones are found in mines, while synthetic stones are produced by machines. \n  TIP! D   \nBe cautious of the way all of your pieces of jewelry gets stored together. It is better to use boxes, compartments, holders, and hooks so that everything is kept separate. Do not just throw them in a pile. This can damage fragile jewelry, and items like necklaces can entangle with each other and other pieces into a big mess. \n \nIf you can prevent your jewelry from tarnishing, it will surely look much more attractive. Remove your jewelry if you plan on spending time in or near water. Water can cause some metals to lose their luster or to become tarnished or rusty. To give jewelry an added layer of protection apply a thin layer of clear nail lacquer. \n  TIP! Try out the jewelery by wearing it for a period of time, like a day, so you can see whether it?s uncomfortable or doesn?t hang as well as you hoped. It will also allow you to test the piece?s durability.   Synthetic Gems  \nWhen you are buying new jewelery, think about the stones you want to get. The stone will look best on you if it is complementary to your skin tone, eye, and hair color. Also think about what color clothing you wear often, and chose a neutral color that will match many of the outfits in your closet. You want to have plenty of opportunities to show off every piece. \n  TIP! Taking good care of your jewelry is important if you want it to last. Every metal, setting, and stone has different requirements when it comes to care.   \nKnow the distinctions between kinds of stone you are buying with your jewelry. There are three unique types of stones: imitation, synthetic gems and imitation stones. Natural and synthetic are both real, but imitation gems are probably just colored glass or plastic. Natural stones are dug up out of the ground and synthetic gems are created in a lab. \n \nHave a unique piece of jewelry made for the special person on your gift list. Show your affection for the person by recognizing their unique qualities; put some thought into the purchase and be creative. \n  TIP! To preserve the pristine look of your jewelry, apply your make-up first, wait for it to set, then put on your jewelry. If you put on makeup after you put on your jewelry, dust and particles from the makeup will migrate to the jewelry, which makes it dirty quite quickly.   \nBefore buying a new item of jewelry, look at the latest jewelry trends. The only thing that beats getting a fantastic piece of jewelry is getting it for a discounted price! \n \nBefore you purchase gemstone jewelry, you should first determine if and how the stone was treated. Depending on the type of treatment used, the piece will require varying types of care. You want to avoid unknowingly cleaning the gem with a chemical or solution that could strip off the protective treatment. \n  TIP! If you are trying to sell jewelry on the Internet, make sure that you present it in an attractive way. This is extremely important because the potential buyer can not handle the item that is being sold.   \nAlways ask the jeweler about insurance policy options before buying a new piece of jewelry. If your jewelry becomes damaged, you can take it back and see if they will fix it! Some jewelers will offer insurance on jewelry pieces that might have been stolen or stolen. \n \nA diamond?s cut, as well as its clarity, are considerably more important than size in determining value and appeal. Most important of all, make sure that the piece you choose complements the nature of the intended receiver. \n  TIP! This includes both dry and steam saunas. The high levels of moisture and heat are very damaging to the jewelry.   \nYou have plenty of options when it comes to buying, giving, selling, and caring for jewelry. You need not let the wealth of different opportunities overwhelm you! The ideas here should help you get the right piece regardless of your relationship. \n \nWhen you are buying jewelry for someone, it may be a good idea to buy a set instead of just one piece. You can easily get a set of jewelery at a good price. You can divide up the set into individual pieces and give them out one at a time. This practice will ensure that you have appealing gifts planned out for a long time in the future. \n  TIP! Brand name should not be the primary concern when buying jewelry. Most people will not really know where you discovered the piece.   \nA lot of people wish to figure out Are you looking for Single men throughout these American States and all over the USA: \nCalifornia, District of Columbia, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Arkansas, New Jersey, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Idaho, South Dakota, Wisconsin! \n \nTry to find younger men within the next American Towns: ?

But there are still several details you ought to spend some time figuring out before you tell everybody about your plans to retire:\n\nPlan on a good time to say goodbye. Your colleagues in the workplace are often people you've been with for years. Don't leave them stranded in the middle of a big project simply because you want to quit for good. There's no need to rub it in everybody's faces that you get to skip all those boring meetings. They already know this without being reminded. Plus, work connections may remain useful even after you retire, perhaps if you need a referral for a consulting job or a favor for your son's job search.\n\nFigure out where you want to live. You should have built plenty of equity in your home by now, and it may make sense for you to move to a cheaper (or warmer) place to spend your retirement days. Even if you don't plan to move to another geographical area, and use the savings you've built to increase your lifestyle a bit. This is a decision that drastically changes the calculus on how much you need to save, so it's best if you have the details figured out while you can still earn extra income if you need to.\n\nKnow exactly how you will replace your paycheck. You need an income strategy for retirement that helps you to avoid drawing down your savings too quickly or slowly. With as well as different investments with different cost basis lots, failing to plan may leave you paying a ton of unnecessary taxes that could easily be avoided by planning ahead.\n\nReassess insurance needs. Once you retire, you likely you've been paying for years. Can you get out of it? For some people it makes sense to stop paying the premiums because your family simply is no longer relying on your income from your job. While there are some situations when it makes sense to hold on to your life insurance policy, don't keep on paying simply because the amount is automatically deducted from your checking account every month.\n\nCall up the car insurance agent. Now that you won't be commuting, you should ask for a low mileage discount. Other options you might have opted to pay for, like being reimbursed for a rental car, may not be necessary now that your family doesn't absolutely need both cars operational every single day. There might be other discounts as well. The bottom line is that a phone call could save you hundreds of dollars every year. Call now.\n\nSeek out senior discounts. Join AARP and take advantage of the available to seniors. Be on the lookout for senior rates on everything from public transportation to movies to museum admissions. Senior discounts are a major advantage of getting older.\n\nPlan your schedule. The happiest retirees often have their schedules filled with activities. From hobbies to outings with friends to volunteering, retirement doesn't necessary mean sitting at home all day and doing nothing. Retirement is not the end of your career, but the start of another chapter in your life.\n\nDecide if retirement will make you happier. If you are not ecstatic about leaving the workforce, I would argue that you . Meeting your retirement needs is much more than just having the financials figured out. If you aren't ready yet, then stop counting the days until you retire and start figuring out what you are missing. Make more friends, develop hobbies and find a purpose in life. These things won't magically appear for you the day you retire.\n\nVisit MoneyNing.com for more personal finance discussions.

        "title": "What iPhone, iPad owners need to know about iOS 7",
        "content": "(CNN) -- Apple is releasing its latest operating system for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch today.\n\nThe system, iOS 7, will come installed on the new iPhone 5S and 5C models that go on sale Friday. Owners of some older Apple devices also can download it to replace their current systems. But should they?\n\nBefore you jump in and upgrade, here's what you need to know about iOS 7.\n\nWhat is iOS 7?\n\nApple's iOS is the software that controls all the basics of your gadget, including the look, feel, settings and hardware. iOS 7 is Apple's latest update to this system and its biggest change since iOS debuted six years ago.\n\nWhat time is the iOS 7 download available?\n\nDevelopers have been testing early versions of the new operating system for months, but Apple made it available to the general public at 1 p.m. ET today.\n\nTo see whether it is available, go to Settings  General  Software Update on your device, or visit iTunes on your computer.\n\nHow is it different from what's already on my iPhone or iPad?\n\nSix years is a long time to wear the same look. Apple's iOS has received a major design overhaul in this version and now has a more streamlined, flat, abstract look. The typography is all new, and nice touches like transparency and subtle animations abound.\n\nThere are also a handful of new features, though some are not available on all older devices. Here are a few of the biggies:\n\n? A new time-saving control center slides up from the bottom of the screen for easy access to basic settings such as brightness and Airplane Mode. It has shortcuts for the flashlight, timer, calculator and camera.\n\n? An updated notification center now shows a summary of what you have in store for the day and details on the weather and your commute.\n\n? The camera adds a square-photo option and new filters, while the photos app drops the map view and sorts your images into events by date and location.\n\n? It adds AirDrop, a feature for people who use iCloud that makes it easier to move photos and files between computers and mobile devices.\n\n? The Siri voice-search tool adds an option for male voice, defaults to Bing for Web searches and pulls in results from Twitter and Wikipedia.\n\n? Multitasking looks different. The same double-click of the home button now zooms you out to show a carousel of mini versions of all your open apps.\n\niOS 7 won't require a great deal of re-learning. The basic layout and functions are the same: The home screen is still a grid of icons, there's a dock with your favorite apps at the bottom, and the gestures you've become used to work the same. There will probably be some initial confusion as you struggle to re-identify all the new icons, but a proper upgrade should leave them all in the same spots they were in before.\n\nCan I update my iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch?\n\nAlthough iOS is coming out the same time as a pair of brand new iPhone models, it can also be installed for free on some older devices.\n\nAt the press event announcing the new models, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were 600 million devices running iOS. Just because you have a year-old iPhone 5 doesn't mean you can't freshen it up with the latest operating system. Look for your device below to see whether it is eligible.\n\n? iPhone (original): No\n\n? iPhone 3G: No\n\n? iPhone 3GS: No\n\n? iPhone 4: Yes. Does not include AirDrop, Siri or camera filters (you can add filters later in the photos app).\n\n? iPhone 4S: Yes. No AirDrop.\n\n? iPhone 5: Yes. Includes all new iOS 7 features.\n\n? iPod Touch: Only the 5th-generation iPod Touch can upgrade but will include all new iOS 7 features.\n\n? iPad (original): No\n\n? iPad 2: Yes. No AirDrop, Siri, camera filters or square format, or Photos app filters.\n\n? iPad 3rd generation: Yes. No AirDrop or camera filters.\n\n? iPad 4th generation: Yes\n\n? iPad Mini: Yes\n\nSome of the cooler new features you may have heard about, like the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the new camera tools -- slow-motion, burst mode and image-stabilization -- are available only on the new Phone 5S.\n\nShould I update?\n\nJust because your device is compatible doesn't mean it should be upgraded right away. Once you update your device to iOS 7, there is no going back to iOS 6 or whichever earlier iOS you were running. (Yes, there are unofficial ways to downgrade, but these are not recommended for regular iPhone and iPad users.)\n\nIf you are not in a rush, wait a few weeks or months until Apple releases the first updated version of iOS 7. The early releases of the operation system can include bugs that should be addressed with subsequent iOS 7 updates. Let other eager people spend the next few weeks finding and reporting these issues so you don't have to deal with them.\n\nOlder devices can experience frustrating performance issues when upgraded to a new OS. The iOS 7 software was designed specifically for the hardware that's faster than your trusty old iPhone 4. If your device is anything older than the most recent generation, it might suddenly slow down, and battery life can suffer.\n\nThis should not be as much of a problem for newer devices, such as the iPhone 5, 4th generation iPad and iPad Mini, or the latest iPod Touch. If you are worried about performance issues, skip the update.\n\nUpdating immediately is recommended only for tech-savvy early adopters who are comfortable with the risks.\n\nAre there any downsides of not updating?\n\nImmediately, not much. You won't have the new features to play with, but your phone will continue to work as it always did.\n\nIn the long run, there could be a few drawbacks. Apple has been pushing developers to update their apps to be iOS 7 compatible. The updates can be as minor as changing the look of an icon or as major as adding all new features. Many developers may stop updating and supporting older versions of their apps as they move their focus to iOS 7. That means eventually, you could be stuck with out-of-date (or even non-working) versions of your favorite apps.\n\nI'm going for it! How do I upgrade?\n\n1. Back up: Before you make the leap, it is very important that you back up your iPhone or iPad. There is always a small chance your device could be wiped clean in the upgrade process, so make a full backup of everything. To back up, plug your device into your computer, open iTunes, and if it does not start backing up automatically, click the \"Back Up Now\" button.\n\nIf your photos are not set to back up automatically, use Image Capture or iPhone on a Mac and Windows Explorer on a Windows PC to make copies of all your pictures.\n\nAnother option is to skip the cord and back up to iCloud over Wi-Fi. On your device, go to Settings  iCloud  Storage & Backup. Tap the \"Back Up Now\" button.\n\n2: Download the new iOS: You can get the update by plugging into a computer and opening iTunes (this is the faster option) or over a Wi-Fi connection directly to your phone.\n\nIf iTunes doesn't automatically ask whether you'd like to upgrade when you plug in, click \"Check For Updates\" in the Summary tab. It will do the rest automatically.\n\nFrom your phone, go to Settings  Software Update and click the install button. Make sure your phone is fully charged and connected to a Wi-Fi network, not your cellular network.",

        "title": "U.S. Stocks Soar After Fed Maintains Bond-Buying Efforts",
        "content": "--Stocks close broadly higher after Fed keeps easy-money policies in place \n\n--DJIA finishes up 147.21, setting new closing record; S&P 500 also sets new all-time high, gaining 20.76 \n\n--Utilities lead gains, rally 3% \n\nNEW YORK--U.S. stocks rallied to new all-time highs as the Federal Reserve surprised markets by announcing that its stimulus measures would stay in place. \n\nTreasury prices also rose, with the benchmark 10-year yield settling at 2.706%, its lowest since Aug. 12. (Bond prices move inversely to yields) Prices of mortgage-backed securities leapt even more. Gold and oil futures pushed higher. The dollar slumped against most major currencies. \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee said in its post-meeting policy-setting statement that it would continue to buy $85 billion in bonds each month. Investors expected the central bank to pare its bond-buying programs by between $10 billion and $15 billion at this meeting. \"It's amazing, and certainly not what we thought would happen,\" said Marc Doss, a San Diego, Calif.-based regional chief investment officer with Wells Fargo Private Bank. \"We were definitely in the camp they would do $10 to $15 billion\" less purchasing each month. \n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 147.21 points, or 0.9%, to 15676.94, a new all-time closing high. The S&P 500 index rose 20.76 points, or 1.2%, to 1725.52, well into record territory. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 37.94 points, or 1%, to 3783.64. \n\nStocks extended their record-setting rally after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a press conference that the central bank could move later this year to pare stimulus, but the decision remains tied to economic data and the central bankers don't have a fixed schedule to end its bond purchasing. \n\nInvestors are now trying to discern what will come next from the Fed. \"Now we're back to this, where every [economic] report we're going to have to parse to see what the Fed thinks,\" said Mr. Doss. Stocks have rallied to new highs this year as earnings growth has slowed. Investors and strategists say that the Fed's implied support for the economy has helped bolster stocks. The S&P 500 had gained 19% this year ahead of the Fed meeting. \n\nNow that the Fed will continue that support, \"markets are going to continue to be pretty frothy,\" said Kenneth Taubes, chief investment officer of Pioneer Investments. \"We're going to get lower rates on top of a better economy... we're going to continue to see higher equity prices.\" Utilities shares, which often trade as proxies for the bond market, saw the biggest jump in the S&P 500, rallying 3%. Materials and technology shares were also among the biggest gainers, rising 2.3% and 1.4%, respectively. \n\nA.C. Morgan, managing director in equities trading at UBS AG, said he saw buying by a diverse set of investors after the statement--and noted several of the big-picture issues that have troubled investors of late have fallen by the wayside. \"Syria, that's gone. Who's going to replace Bernanke? That's gone,\" he said. \"And what's tapering going to look like? We don't have to worry about that right now.\" While the Fed's decision sparked a rally, some investors were left unsettled that the central bank didn't think the economy was strong enough for a withdrawal of stimulus efforts. \"The Fed believes the economy is weaker than most of us assume,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. \"Do they know something we don't know? This does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.\" He said he would be rethinking his view on U.S. stocks after the Fed's statement. \"We're still inclined to have risk in the portfolio, but this may cause us to rethink some of our positions,\" said Mr. Ablin. \"Perhaps we move to more of an emphasis in other markets, like international developed and Europe, perhaps shift away from a U.S.-centric view.\" Wells Fargo's Mr. Doss said he was rethinking his view on U.S. markets as well, and is looking closely at emerging markets, as \"there was a lot of dislocation going on\" as a result of the Fed discussion. \"It's not necessarily perfect news for [U.S.] equities,\" he said. \"I know we're rallying today, but it's a longer-term question mark.\" It wasn't yet clear whether the buying would turn into long-term bets from investors, said Doug Crofton, managing director in cash equities with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He said that much of the trading volume came in exchange-traded funds, an area where investors tend to make global macroeconomic bets or short-term trades. \"We'll see if this move is sustainable,\" he said. \"Our flows aren't suggesting it yet.\" Markets were roiled in May and June as Fed officials first began to speak about taking a step back from easy-money policies. Treasurys have sold off since then, pushing the yield on the 10-year note briefly above 3% earlier this month. It started January around 1.8%. Among the market's other worries are budget discussions in Washington, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds, which could change the Fed's timetable. The government could shut down after Sept. 30 if Congress doesn't act, and lawmakers are also facing a fight over the debt ceiling. \"The most identifiable threat to the economy is some standoff that could cause the government to default or shut down,\" he said. In corporate news, FedEx Corp. climbed 5% after the package-delivery company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that topped analyst forecasts and affirmed its full-year outlook. \n\nAdobe Systems Inc. rallied 9.2% after the maker of Photoshop and Illustrator design software reported more \"Creative Cloud\" subscribers than expected, which offset disappointing fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue. \n\n-Tomi Kilgore and Matt Jarzemsky contributed to this article. \n\nWrite to Alexandra Scaggs at alexandra.scaggs@wsj.com \n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires",

I have not decided yet what color scheme I want but I am leaning towards a mix of pastel shades (maybe mint green, teal, pale peach or lilac). I am also considering changing the cabinetry and installing more lights. Hey, a girl can dream!† Our apartment is tiny and is a little cramped (I've amassed quite a number of kitchen appliances and utensils) so installing shelving would be a lifesaver. The cabinets under the sink are rarely used too so I plan to make full use of it and free up some floor space. I'm not sure if this is a good decision considering that we will be moving to our permanent house in the next year or so. I think I will just throw caution to the wind this time and just make our little nest more chic and functional (not industrial).† I like this because of the cabinets (clean/solid/roomy). Photo Credit I like the overhead shelf where you can put some potted plants, books and other knick knacks.\nPhoto Credit This cork board doubles as a cabinet door and a place to maybe display some recipes or pictures.\nPhoto Credit† This looks so fresh and clean and I like it a lot.\nPhoto Credit And a home for the spices and powders and all those little jars...\nPhoto Credit My dream kitchen!!! I could stay in this place forever. Haha! I hope the husband approves.\nPhoto Credit I like the country feel of this kitchen too. I think the husband will like this for sure. Photo Credit Ahhhh, there's just too many ideas out there. I hope I can make this happen, we can make this happen. I'll keep you all posted.† Tweet Pin It",

        "content": "Amazon has just unleashed a massive new update for their Kindle app for iOS 7. Users of the iPhone and iPad will finally be able to access X-Ray and Book Extras on their devices. This is the first time X-Ray is available anywhere but Amazon e-Readers and Tablets. \n \nX-Ray is a popular feature that gives you an indication of the people, places and things in a particular novel. You can get a sense on who the main characters they are and how often they are referenced throughout the book. If you are juggling many books at once or just coming back to one after a long hideous, you can immediately see who the major players are. \n \nThe new Kindle app is also optimized for iOS 7 and features an all-new new design, as well as Collections, which make it easy for customers to organize their books, documents, and magazines. Collections on Kindle are unique because customers can add their content to multiple categories, rather than just one ? for example, put A Game of Thrones in ?My Favorites? as well as ?Fantasy Epics?. \n  \n \nAmazon Brings X-Ray to Apple iPad and iPhone is a post from: E-Reader News",

        "title": "Second OverDrive ?Big Library Read? Project Includes School Libraries",
        "content": "Earlier this year, digital content distributor OverDrive partnered with publisher Sourcebooks in an experiment aimed at establishing concrete data on how readers respond in terms of book borrows and book sales to digital titles they check out from their libraries. Sourcebooks made one of its titles available to OverDrive?s member libraries for a predetermined period of time with unlimited simultaneous access in order to track the book?s sales, the author?s social media connections, and more. This experiment provided what many supporters of ebook lending have known: readers like to borrow ebooks and they often purchase a borrowed title or its sequel after checking out the ebook from their local libraries. \n \nNow, OverDrive is partnering with HarperCollins on a second installment of the project, this time using a children?s book and including school libraries in the experiment. In addition, the audiobook of this title will be available as well at no-cost and with multiple checkouts, just like the digital title. \n \nParticipating libraries will feature the title, Jane O?Connor?s Nancy Clancy: Super Sleuth , on their homepages and invite patrons to borrow the digital edition. Patrons must have a valid library card in order to borrow the title. \n \nAccording to a press release on this second installment in the Big Library Read, ?Based on the success of the first Big Library Read in May, schools were invited for the first time to join public libraries to enjoy the benefits of no-cost, simultaneous access to a popular children?s eBook. Also for the first time, the downloadable audiobook version will be available for simultaneous access. The 2nd Big Library Read is off to a fast start: The first two days saw thousands of checkouts of the title worldwide, circulating more than OverDrive?s top three most downloaded combined. The program will conclude on September 30.? \n \n \n \nSecond OverDrive ?Big Library Read? Project Includes School Libraries is a post from: E-Reader News",

        "content": "Home / News / GDC 2013: Kingdom Hearts Project <3 Officially Announced \n\nGDC 2013: Kingdom Hearts Project <3 Officially Announced \n\nUpdate: As a surprise to none of the skeptics out there and heartbreaking to everyone else, this news was the act of an April Fools joke. The image used below is a reworked image and you can see the original image below. Feel free to leave all of your hate for this awful holiday in the comments below! \n\nOriginal: Square Enix held a private conference during GDC 2013 and during it Shinji Hashimoto announced Kingdom Hearts Project <3. This latest project is the heavily anticipated Kingdom Hearts 3 and apparently been in production for a long time. \n\nHere is the small amount of information we know already about Project <3: \n\n-It?s release will be sometime after Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix \n\n-The game has been in production for some time. \n\n-The code name of the project is \"Project <3\" \n\n-Several rumored worlds to appear are Agrabah (Princes of Thieves maybe?) and Andy?s Room (Toy \n\nStory). They are currently looking into adding a couple more Pixar worlds. \n\n-The title will feature Sora, Riku, Donald, and Goofy as playable characters. Kairi is also rumored \n\nto be playable but the current aspect is unknown. \n\n-?Newer? Final Fantasy characters will make an appearance as cameos. (Final Fantasy XII & XIII) \n\nThis announcement may be just what some have been waiting for, but still leaves many questions open. Such as what platform will it be on and what team is working on this with Final Fantasy Versus XIII still in the works? \n\nSome could even view this as the companies last chance to turn things around after recent financial troubles and Yoichi Wada stepping down from the company. What do you think of the announcement and where would you like to see Kingdom Hearts 3 on? Let us know in the comments below and also take a look at our recent feature talking about how Square Enix is handling Kingdom Hearts. \n\nSOURCE: Kingdom Hearts Ultimania \n\nTAGS: \n\nYou need to login or register to comment on this news story.",

I was going through a really tough time.\"\n\nIn 1988, Panfil earned an associate's degree of science in pre-engineering and a second associate's degree of applied science and electronics technology. He later went on to earn his bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois and his masters from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.\n\nPanfil, now the director of enrollment management for the Elmhurst College: School for Professional Studies, is one of 11 members on the newly formed alumni organization committee, which includes former students and college employees.\n\nPanfil said all too often, community and junior colleges are overlooked. \n\nCommunity colleges offer certificates and associate's degrees, provide networking opportunities, and help older students learn new skills to meet increasing demands for today's workforce, he said.\n\nThe schools also help younger first-time students earn credits before they transfer into four-year universities.\n\nElena Couto, manager of alumni relations and development at Oakton, said there had been an alumni organization during the 1980s and early 1990s that faded out.\n\nCouto was hired in November to work with Oakton's educational foundation and was charged with reestablishing the alumni organization.\n\n\"Alumni organizations are becoming more important, with public funding eroding and people having to find different ways to fund community colleges,\" Couto said.\n\nBut the purpose of the non-dues-based organization will be far more than just raising funds for the college and establishing scholarships for existing students, she said.\n\nThe hope is that alumni also will provide current students with mentoring and career counseling.\n\n\"The mission is two-fold,\" she said. \"One is to cultivate relationships with our alumni, make them feel like they are still part of the community, [and] offer professional and personal development opportunities. The hope is that [alumni] become more engaged with the college, that they support current students through fundraising, mentoring, exploring different ways that alumni can support the college and the students that are here now.\"\n\nOrganizers are now diving into the tasks of forming the alumni group, as well as finding and reconnecting with alumni.\n\nThe college has been open since 1970. There is information for at least 50,000 alums collected on an electronic database, plus countless more on microfiche. So far, there have been 340 alums contacted via email, organizers said.\n\nTheresa Bashiri-Remetio, 29, of Park Ridge and a member of the alumni organization committee, recalls going to Oakton as a young child with her mother who was earning a degree in nursing. \n\nShe would draw and color, or listen to music in the cafeteria, while her mom took classes.\n\nShe later attended Oakton as a student, earned an associate's degree in 2009 and a certificate in public relations in 2011, and is on track to earn another certificate this spring to work as a certified public accountant.\n\nShe said before entering Oakton as a part-time student in 2006, she was \"considerably lost as to where my life was headed. \n\n\"I had worked several minimum-wage jobs,\" Bashiri-Remetio said. \"I was working 80 hours a week. I decided to explore my options at Oakton.\"\n\nToday, she works full-time at Colliers International, a commercial real estate firm in Rosemont.\n\nShe said an alumni organization is a valuable tool for bringing together the community and providing support for today's students.\n\n\"Oakton plays a huge role in the community it serves,\" Bashiri-Remetio said. \"Bringing together everyone that has had their lives changed by the college, it's just a great thing.\"\n\nThe next alumni association meeting will be held Nov. 7. Anyone interested in assisting the committee should visit oakton.edu/alumni.\n\ntriblocaltips@tribune.com",

Considering my essay was all about the article and the author's name had been mentioned prior, I didn't bother adding the author's last name before the page number. I quoted several things from the article.\n\nI'm on my citation page. I've already cited the article; does this one citation cover the quotes from the article, or do I need a separate citation for each quote? \n\nThank you.",

        "title": "Open Question: Need advice for my story when a timid geek is locked out in the buff?",
        "content": "Donnie was 19 years old and always a lovable geek. The only one of his friends who was still a virgin, he was always teased by friends for being so conservative that he wouldn't even take his shirt off at the beach. He was shy, but wasn't fat or skinny. Perhaps he had a bit of baby fat on his belly, but that's all. His best friend Ashley would always tease him about having a \"bubble butt\" under his jeans, much to his dismay.\n\nOne day he was waiting at home alone during the day for a package to arrive, when he thought he heard something left at the backdoor. He was in such a hurry that he ran to the door wearing nothing but his towel. Being a bit of a klutz, as he opened the door he tripped and stumbled out the door as it clicked shut. As he felt the cold wood on his bare butt-cheeks, and looked in terror through the window at his towel hanging on a loose nail in the wall, he panics as he realizes that he is locked out of his house as bare as a newborn baby!\n\nThere's absolutely nothing in the yard to cover himself with. Not even a trash bag!\n\nCan you please answer the following questions?\n\n1. As he looks down in horror at his totally bare body, what does he say out loud to himself?\n\n2. His attractive, 45 year old neighbor, Mrs. Jenson comes home and says \"Hi Donnie! How are you?\" He realizes that from her angle by the fence, she has no idea that he's not wearing a stitch of clothes, she can only see that he is topless. What is going through his head as he's having a 3 minute conversation? And what could Mrs. Jenson say that is innocent, but makes Donnie panic and THINK she knows that he's in his birthday suit?\n\n3. As he's running bare across the yard past the big gap in the fence trying to find the spare key, a car drives by driven by a girl he went to high school with and she yells WHAT out the window about his virginity and his exposed butt that makes him literally dive behind a bush in embarrassment?\n\n4. Eventually, his mother comes home and lets him in, and says or does WHAT that takes away his dignity as Donnie runs past her into the house?\n\n5. Turns out he logs on from home and sees himself, totally exposed, captured from behind in a picture that the girl who drove by posted on Instagram. What hashtags does she use for the picture?\n\nTHANK YOU!!!",

        "title": "Quincy man arrested on gun charge tells police he got out of prison thanks to former state chemist Annie Dookhan",
        "content": "By John R. Ellement, Globe Staff\n\nWhen Jamell T. Spurill was arrested by Boston police for illegal possession of a handgun on Sunday, he did not talk about the loaded Walther P99C handgun to arresting officers. \n\nInstead, authorities said, he talked about his affection for Annie Dookhan, the former state chemist whose alleged mishandling of drug samples has affected thousands of prosecutions ? including one against Spurill.\n\n?I just got out thanks to Annie Dookhan,?? Spurill allegedly told police. ?I love that lady.? \n\nSpurill apparently was referring to the cocaine dealing case in Plymouth County Superior Court that sent him to prison in 2011 for three years ? after he pleaded guilty to three separate charges.\n\nHe was still behind bars last fall when attorneys sought his freedom on the grounds that Dookhan had so tainted the drug evidence in the case that Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz?s office could no longer prosecute him.\n\nCruz?s office formally dropped the case against Spurill in January, citing the interests of justice, according to court records. Spurill has been a free man since at least this winter, the records said.\n\nBut that ended around 9 a.m. Sunday when Boston police pulled over a vehicle near Circuit and Fountain streets after an officer noticed it had an expired inspection sticker, according to Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley?s office.\n\nAt the wheel was Shaki Muhammed, 27, of Norwood, who police soon learned had her right to drive suspended by the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Spurill was a passenger. \n\nBoth were ordered out of the vehicle by police, who then proceeded to conduct a routine search, prosecutors said. During the search, officers allegedly found the handgun in the glove box of the car. The pistol, which had one round in the chamber and six in the magazine, had been reported stolen, prosecutors said.\n\nMuhammed was charged with receiving stolen property over $250, unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license, and driving without an inspection sticker, prosecutors said.\n\nShe faced enhanced sentencing as a Level II armed career criminal, prosecutors said. In 2006, she was convicted of distribution of a Class B substance and possession with intent to distribute a Class B substance, according to prosecutors. \n\nWhen Muhammed was asked for her permit to carry a handgun, she allegedly replied, ?What?s that??\n\nSpurill, 31, of Quincy faces charges of receiving stolen property over $250, unlawful possession of a firearm as a second or subsequent offense, and unlawful possession of ammunition as a second or subsequent offense. \n\nHe also faces enhanced sentencing as a Level III armed career criminal. According to prosecutors, Spurill was convicted of possession with intent to distribute drugs in 2010; unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun, unlawful possession of a firearm, and unlawful possession of ammunition in 2008; assault and battery in 2003, 2005, and 2006; and assault in 2000.\n\nBoth Muhammed and Spurill were arraigned in Roxbury Municipal Court Monday where they pleaded not guilty to all charges. Bail was set at $50,000 cash for Spurill and $15,000 for Muhammed, prosecutors said.\n\nSince the drug scandal exploded into public view last year, Suffolk County prosecutors have dropped, or allowed a defendant to be released on bail, in 200 cases. Suffolk prosecutors said 61 people have been re-arrested since gaining freedom through the Dookhan scandal.\n\nJohn R. Ellement can be reached at ellement@globe.com.

        "title": "National Cheeseburger Day {& Burger Station Ideas}",
        "content": "Happy National Cheeseburger Day! We love burgers and especially mini burgers. Many couples today choose their favorite foods to serve at their wedding, and often we see mini burgers. This is a great idea because almost everyone loves a good†burger. We also love the idea of a Burger Station! This would be fun for an engagement party, couples shower, rehearsal dinner, or reception. \n \n\n \nWhen doing a Burger Station below are some ideas on the variety of options you can have for your guests: \n \nVariety of BUNS! (wheat, white, sesame, garlic, onion, and more) \n \nThe MEAT! Of course you are going to have classic beef for your burgers. †For your guests who are a bit more health conscious you can have turkey burgers and then also veggie or black bean burgers for those who may be vegetarian. \n \nCHEESE Please! No burger is complete without cheese, so you want to be sure to have a variety of cheeses. The classic American cheese is of course a must. Other flavorful favs: swiss, pepper jack, colby, mozzarella, gouda, bleu cheese, the list goes on and on! \n \nDRESS your burger! No burger would be complete without the crunch and flavor of some of our favorite vegetable toppings. You want to be sure to have the classics: lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle. For those who like to jazz up their burger, some other options to include: jalapenos, sautÈed bell peppers and onions, sautÈed mushrooms, and avocado \n \nTOPPINGS! Some people really like to step outside the box when creating their burger. Again, the possibilities are endless when it comes to toppings but some great burger toppings to include are: bacon (duh), fried egg (yes, an egg. This interesting burger topping has become quite popular over the last few years!), chili, marinara sauce, bbq sauce, and really whatever your heart desires! Of course you cannot forget the classics like ketchup, mayonnaise and mustard. If you want to keep it more on the simple side and not offer as many topping options, just offer a few more varieties of mustard like classic, spicy, Dijon and honey mustard. \n \nFRIES! We cannot forget the fries! A side of fries is a must when serving burgers. Classic french fries are always a hit along with sweet potato fries. Now if you REALLY want to go all out with your burger station, why not go ahead and have a French Fry Station! Some of the same toppings we listed above could work for your fry station as well. Or keep it fun and simple and have your fries ready to go in cute little paper cones for your guests. \n \nNow I?m sure after all of that we are not the only ones craving a good ol? burger, right?",
