School is a place where children are compelled to be, and where their freedom is greatly restricted — far more restricted than most adults would tolerate in their workplaces. In recent decades, we have been compelling our children to spend ever more time in this kind of setting, and there is strong evidence (summarized in my [Peter Gray&#39;s] recent book [&quot;Free to Learn&quot;]) that this is causing serious psychological damage to many of them. Moreover, the more scientists have learned about how children naturally learn, the more we have come to realize that children learn most deeply and fully, and with greatest enthusiasm, in conditions that are almost opposite to those of school.<br /><br />Most students — whether A students, C students, or failing ones — have lost their zest for learning by the time they reach middle school or high school. With each successive grade, students develop increasingly negative attitudes toward the subjects taught, especially math and science. Research has shown that people of all ages learn best when they are self-motivated, pursuing questions that are their own real questions, and goals that are their own real-life goals. In such conditions, learning is usually joyful.<br /><br />Over many years, I’ve observed learning at one such place, the Sudbury Valley School, in Framingham, Mass. It’s called a school, but is as different as you can imagine from what we usually think of as “school.”  The students, who range in age from 4 to about 18, are free all day to do whatever they want, as long as they don’t break any of the school rules. The rules, which are created democratically at the School Meeting by students and staff together, have nothing to do with learning; they have to do with keeping peace and order and are enforced by a judicial system modeled after that of our larger society. The school currently has about 150 students and 10 staff members, and it operates on a per-student budget that is less than half that of the surrounding public schools. It accepts essentially all students who apply and whose parents agree to enroll them.<br /><br />To people who haven’t witnessed it firsthand, it’s hard to imagine how such a school could work. Yet Sudbury Valley has been in existence now for 45 years and has hundreds of graduates, who are doing just fine in the real world. Many years ago, my colleague David Chanoff and I conducted a follow-up study of the school’s graduates. We found that those who had pursued higher education (about 75 percent) reported no particular difficulty getting into the schools of their choice and doing well there once admitted. Some, including a few who had never previously taken a formal course, had gone on successfully to highly prestigious colleges and universities. As a group, regardless of whether or not they had pursued higher education, they were remarkably successful in finding employment.<br /><br />I’m convinced that Sudbury Valley works so well as an educational setting because it provides the conditions that optimize children’s natural abilities to educate themselves. These conditions include a) unlimited opportunity to play and explore (which allows them to discover and pursue their interests); b) access to a variety of caring and knowledgeable adults who are helpers, not judges; c) free age mixing among children and adolescents (age-mixed play is far more conducive to learning than is play among those who are all at the same level); and d) direct participation in a stable, moral, democratic community in which they acquire a sense of responsibility for others, not just for themselves. Think about it: None of these conditions are present in standard schools. The natural drives and abilities of young people to learn are fully sufficient to motivate their entire education.","attachments":[{"displayName":"School is a prison — and damaging our kids","fullImage":{"url":"http://media.salon.com/2013/08/student_asleep-150x150.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"url":"http://www.salon.com/2013/08/26/school_is_a_prison_and_damaging_our_kids/","objectType":"article","content":"Longer school years aren't the answer.

Grease a standard 12 muffin pan with melted butter. Set aside.<br /><br />Make the pesto:<br />In a food processor or blender, add the basil, parsley, garlic, pine nuts, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt and pepper, Pulse a few times until the mixture becomes coarse and chopped. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula and pulse once more. With the machine running, slowly pour in the olive oil and pulse briefly to make a coarse paste. The mixture should be thick and slightly creamy. Add the Parmesan and pulse once more to incorporate. Give the pesto a taste, if it is lacking in salt or pepper, add more to taste. Transfer the pesto to a bowl and set aside. It will yield about 1 cup of pesto.<br /><br />Make the batter:<br />In a large bowl, stir or sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and milk. Stir in the thawed and squeezed-dried spinach into the wet ingredients. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and pour the spinach mixture into the center. Fold the batter until evenly moistened. The batter will be slightly lumpy. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the pesto and mozzarella just until evenly distributed. Some streaks of pesto may remain, that will give the muffins color. Do not worry about mixing everything perfectly together. It is crucial to not overmix this batter as it will result in dry and tough muffins. Using an ice cream scoop or just a regular spoon, fill the muffin cups level with the rim.<br /><br />Bake the muffins until golden brown, dry, and springy to the touch or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through baking to ensure evening browning. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Carefully remove the muffins from the pan. Serve warm or at room temperature. Store any leftover muffins in an airtight container in the fridge. When ready to eat, warm through in a preheated 350°F oven for about 5 minutes.

That&#39;s what we offer guests at Hotel Rembrandt in Quezon City, Philippines — the opportunity to live it up in one of the city&#39;s most vibrant districts.<br /><br />Located along Tomas Morato Extension, the hotel is merely a short walk from popular restaurants and bars. It is also near the headquarters of ABS-CBN, one of the country&#39;s biggest TV networks. Yet Hotel Rembrandt&#39;s great location isn&#39;t the only thing that enables guests to get the most out of their stay.<br /><br />It offers 65 guestrooms with convenient amenities and hotel facilities such as 5 function rooms, salon, and fitness center. The hotel is also staffed by friendly and efficient personnel, whose attention to every detail of the guest experience is similar to the painstaking effort Rembrandt spent in creating his masterpieces. And with all of these at a reasonable price, anyone can afford to live it up just like one of the Old Masters did.<br /><br />Address: 26 Tomas Morato Extension, Quezon City 1104, Philippines<br /><br />For more information, visit <a href=\"http://goo.gl/8U1mWa\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://goo.gl/8U1mWa</a><br /><br /><br />*Book Hotels Online is managed and maintained by the Online Marketing Team of DirectWithHotels.
