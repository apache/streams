                THIS week’s technology news is all Apple, all the time. The Californian gadget-maker announced two new iPhones and a new Apple Watch in its long-awaited presentation on Tuesday. But the iPhone was on the mind of your columnist this week for a different reason. A hurried e-mail typed with overlarge fingers on the tiny screen resulted in more than a few typos. Apple corrects a few of these on the fly; others are underlined, and when the underlined word is tapped, a replacement is suggested. In this case, the replacement suggested was “tucking”, to complete the sequence “how tucking much”.

                IF A gun fires and nobody reports it, does it make a sound? Some police forces are finding out. On September 3rd the Urban Institute, a think-tank, produced a report based on data from Washington DC’s police “ShotSpotter” system, a network of microphones that covers around a quarter of the city. In the 2011-12 school year, the devices detected 336 incidents of gunfire during the school day. Over half the schools in the covered area had at least one gunshot nearby—most of which went unreported.
                Such data are unsettling to parents, but useful to police, who are adopting gunshot-recording technology in ever-greater numbers. DC’s system was one of the first: it has been in operation since 2005. Around 80 forces now use the same ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                APPLE prides itself on constantly re-imagining the future, but even the world’s leading gadget-maker likes to dwell on the past too. Thirty years ago Steve Jobs commanded the stage at the Flint Centre for the Performing Arts near Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino to show off the new Macintosh computer. On September 9th Mr Jobs’s successor, Tim Cook, held a similar performance in the same location to thunderous applause. Those invited were given a chance to play with the gadgets presented on stage: two new iPhones and a wearable device, called the Apple Watch. “This is the next chapter in Apple’s story,” he said, sounding much like the young Mr Jobs in 1984.

                Harold Finney, futurist and cypherpunk, died on August 28th, aged 58

                AS IT turned out, Hal Finney was not Satoshi Nakamoto. But for a short while, at least, some people thought he might be. “Satoshi Nakamoto” is the most famous non-person on the internet. The name is a pseudonym, meant to hide the shadowy programmer (or programmers) behind Bitcoin, a computerised currency designed to liberate money from the control of any central bank. Speculating about his true identity is a popular pastime in some of the more esoteric corners of the web.
                Still, Mr Finney was a good guess. As a cryptographer and a programmer he had the skills, for Bitcoin relies on cryptography to function. Having been an early adopter (he was, with the fabled Mr Nakamoto, a partner in the world’s first ever Bitcoin transaction) he certainly had the pedigree. And he had the beliefs, too. He was one of the ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                DESTROYING the old to make way for the new is the essence of market economies. Karl Marx thought it one of the nastier qualities of capitalism whereas Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist, cast “creative destruction” in more positive light, as the only route to sustained growth. In the 1990s Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, gave the notion a modern sheen with his theory of “disruptive innovation”. The term is now everywhere. Uber is said to be disrupting the taxi business, Cronuts are disrupting breakfast and Twitter is disrupting communication.
                A disruptive innovation, in Mr Christensen’s work, is a very specific thing: a new technology that is inferior in certain respects to existing ones, but has other desirable attributes. He cites eight-inch ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                IN 2004 Amazon, then a $7 billion-a-year online retailer, was starting to build up a technology infrastructure to serve other companies as well as itself. Ten years later, Amazon Web Services (AWS), launched in 2006, is adding enough servers and other gear every day to power the Amazon.com of ten years ago. This breathtaking investment has kept AWS the market leader in the expanding business of cloud computing, which allows firms to lease storage and processing capacity from others, rather than buy and maintain their own servers and data centres. The cloud promised to be revolutionary: it would be cheaper, would keep software more up-to-date and would encourage more collaboration.

                ROBBING a bank used to require a gun and a getaway car. Now hackers can attack financial institutions with a few clicks of a computer mouse. According to reports on August 27th&amp;nbsp;from Bloomberg, America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is now investigating a series of cyber-intrusions at several American banks, including JPMorgan Chase, one of the biggest.
                The attackers are said to have siphoned off large amounts of data, including customers&#039; bank-account details. Quite what their motive is remains a mystery. One theory is that the attacks are the work of Russian hackers retaliating against international sanctions imposed as a result of Russia’s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Another suggests that they are the work of criminals trying to profit from the data they pilfer.

                THE theft by a Russian syndicate of 1.2 billion username and password combinations from 420,000 websites around the world means that the personal details of almost half of all users of the internet must now be considered severely compromised. It can be only a matter of time before the victims find nasty surprises in their bank statements and credit-card accounts. To be on the safe side, anyone who uses financial and shopping websites should change their passwords forthwith—preferably to something longer, more jumbled, and including no word found in any dictionary. The more nonsensical the better.Heads may nod in agreement, but the advice is then promptly ignored. Human nature, being what it is, has a habit of making people the weakest link in any security chain. For instance, passwords that are easy to remember—the ones most people choose—tend to be the easiest for cybercrooks to guess. By contrast, passwords comprising long, random strings of uppercase and lowercase letters plus numbers and other keyboard characters are far more difficult to fathom. Unfortunately, they are also difficult to remember. As a result, users write them down on scraps of paper that get left lying around for prying eyes to see. &amp;nbsp;Basically, two factors determine a password’s strength. The first is the number of guesses an attacker must try to find the correct one. This depends on the ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                HUMANS like to think of themselves as special. But science has a way of puncturing their illusions. Astronomy has demoted Earth from the centre of the universe to just one planet among zillions. Darwin’s theory of evolution has proved that, rather than being made in the image of some divine benefactor, humans are just another twig on the tree of life.

                Those keen to preserve the idea that humans are special can still point to intelligence. Crows may dabble with simple tools and elephants may be able to cope with rudimentary arithmetic. But humans are the only animals with the sort of general braininess needed ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                FOREIGNERS find it hard to believe that Americans—the most fiercely independent people on the planet—have not been allowed to tinker with their mobile phones. Using downloaded software to unlock them, so they can be employed on a different cellular network after existing contracts have expired, is punishable by a fine of up to $500,000 and/or five years in jail. (Unlocking a phone is not called “jail-breaking” for nothing!) Many Americans risk the penalties so they can use their phones on foreign networks while travelling abroad. Others do so to rid their phones of all the annoying craplets installed by their wireless carrier. Under federal law, doing such things has been illegal.The good news is that this nonsense is about to end. A year or so ago, a “We the People” petition on the White House’s website garnered 114,000 signatures for reform of the law—more than enough to grab the Administration&#039;s attention, and to send a wake-up call to lawmakers for action. And so it did. On July 25th, Congress finally passed a bill which makes it legal for Americans to unlock their phones without repercussions. Several days later, President Obama signed The Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act into law.A victory, then, for common sense? Not entirely. Americans’ new freedom to unlock their phones so they can repair or modify them could be quashed next year. The ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                “AFTER a good dinner one can forgive anybody, except for slow servers,” Oscar Wilde might have written were he to pen “A Woman of No Importance” today. Satiated diners have a one-track mind: pay for the meal and leave as quickly as possible. Yet they are often compelled to linger, firstly to attract the attention of a waiter, and then to wait as a credit card terminal is brought to their table.

                NO ONE could mistake Satya Nadella for Steve Ballmer, his predecessor as Microsoft’s boss. The burly Mr Ballmer brought high-decibel bumptiousness; the svelte Mr Nadella (pictured) speaks in measured tones and quotes Eliot, Nietzsche and Rilke in his news conferences and memos. The new style may in time grate as much as the old, but so far investors like what they see. Since Mr Nadella took over in February, the technology giant’s share price has climbed by 23%, to nearly $45—the highest since April 2000, shortly after Mr Ballmer’s tenure began.
                On his first day in the job Mr Nadella said he planned to make Microsoft fit for a “mobile-first and cloud-first world”. Microsoft, the king of the desktop age, has been dethroned by the smartphone revolution. But Mr Nadella thinks the ubiquity ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>Travel mobile apps: Get with the programme</title>

                HERTZ is America&#039;s largest car rental company, and it gets a lot of things right. Gulliver is a regular customer—I like the company&#039;s (nominally fee-based, but in practice free) Gold programme, which removes a lot of hassle. You give Hertz your information in advance, the company sends you an e-mail telling you how to pick up your car, and you can skip the counter and head right for the exit.But this Friday, I had an extremely frustrating experience&amp;nbsp;that exposes a broader problem with many firms that cater to business travellers. Despite the fact that we are on our phones constantly, a good number rental-car companies and airlines have mobile websites and apps that work poorly, if at all.It would seem obvious that in today&#039;s world, a sharp mobile presence is essential. But Hertz&#039;s is especially poor—at least on Android (I haven&#039;t tested it on an iPhone). The app appears to be just the website run within a frame. If you&amp;nbsp;back out of the app, to check your flight number in a browser, for example, you have to start all over again. Everything is highlighted in Hertz&#039;s iconic yellow, which makes it difficult to tell which fields are required or even how to move to the next step in the reservation process. There are&amp;nbsp;tiny radio buttons that are hard to select. And&amp;nbsp;you have to scroll through an immense list of airline names to enter your arrival ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>Productivity: Signs of things to come</title>
            <link>http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/07/productivity-0?fsrc=rss</link>
            <description>LOOKING backward, it is clear that American productivity growth has been pretty disappointing over the past 40 years, with the exception of an IT boomlet lasting from about 1996 to 2004. But past performance need not imply continued disappointment in future. The impressive gathering of innovative momentum in recent years is extraordinarily promising. And we are beginning to get a glimpse of the productivity potential of machine intelligence. A recent, fascinating&amp;nbsp;Wired&amp;nbsp;piece begins:It was one of the most tedious jobs on the internet. A team of Googlers would spend day after day staring at computer screens, scrutinizing tiny snippets of street photographs, asking themselves the same question over and over again: “Am I looking at an address or not?’ Click. Yes. Click. Yes. Click. No.This was a critical part of building the company’s Google Maps service. Knowing the precise address of a building is really helpful information for mapmakers. But that didn’t make life any easier for those poor Googlers who had to figure out whether a string of numbers captured by Google’s roving Street View cars was a phone number, a graffiti tag, or a legitimate address.Then, a few months ago, they were relieved of their agony, after some Google engineers trained the company’s machines to handle this thankless task. Traditionally, computers have muffed this advanced kind of image ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                WHEN he was the boss of Apple, Steve Jobs made little secret of his contempt for selling to big businesses. Once he even referred to their CIOs as chief information “orifices”, through which all orders must pass. Jobs felt that the best way for Apple to prosper was to focus on the consumer. But his successor, Tim Cook, has struck a much friendlier tone about corporate buyers, regularly boasting that Apple’s products are now used by almost all of the world’s largest companies.

            <description>



                ACROSS the repressive Gulf, social media has become an important way for activists and would-be reformers to speak out. In response, governments have tried to crack down or use this to gather information about dissidents. On June 24th Citizen Lab, a Toronto-based cyberspace security outfit, said it had detected specialised spyware being used in Saudi Arabia—the first time it has seen such sophisticated software in that country. (The Saudi authorities have not responded to these allegations).The software, known as a remote control device (RCS), can hack into mobile phones, giving the government access to all the user’s information—what he or she has looked at or written online and the call history, for example. Unlike basic surveillance software, the RCS can also transform the device into a monitoring tool by switching on and controlling the camera and microphone, without the user noticing.Citizen Lab and Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights group that is also looking into the case, reckon the Saudi government is using this particular software to monitor activists in the eastern province of Qatif, home to the country’s minority community of Shia Muslims.&amp;nbsp;Anti-government protests took place there in 2011 and 2012.Citizen Lab says the software was disguised as a copy of a mobile phone news application called Qatif Today. Once downloaded, the corrupted version ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <description>



                IN OUR&amp;nbsp;special report&amp;nbsp;on cyber-security in this week’s issue of The Economist, we highlighted the threat posed by so-called “zero-day vulnerabilities” in software. Spooks and cyber-criminals love to get their hands on these&amp;nbsp;flaws&amp;nbsp;because they are not yet widely known and so no “patch”, or fix, is available for them. Nefarious types can exploit zero-days to spy on, or steal from, folk using the software in question until such flaws are discovered. Some firms even deliberately go looking for vulnerabilities and then sell this insight to intelligence agencies.Google is fed up with this state of affairs. The company claims to have seen zero-days used to target human-rights activists and conduct industrial espionage. It has also been targeted by intelligence agencies keen to snoop on everything from web searches to e-mails. So its eagerness to crack down on zero-days is hardly surprising.&amp;nbsp;On July 15th&amp;nbsp;Google announced&amp;nbsp;that it was setting up&amp;nbsp;Project Zero, a team of security researchers dedicated to hunting down zero-days in popular software and bringing their existence to light.&amp;nbsp;The trickiness with unearthing zero-days is how to report their existence. If a flaw is revealed before a patch is available, then plenty of crooks and spooks alerted to its existence could try to exploit it. Project Zero’s team says it will send reports of ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                THE TERM “CYBERSPACE” was coined by William Gibson, a science-fiction writer. He first used it in a short story in 1982, and expanded on it a couple of years later in a novel, “Neuromancer”, whose main character, Henry Dorsett Case, is a troubled computer hacker and drug addict. In the book Mr Gibson describes cyberspace as “a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators” and “a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system.”
                His literary creation turned out to be remarkably prescient. Cyberspace has become shorthand for the computing devices, networks, fibre-optic cables, wireless ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                SAFEGUARDING CYBER-SECURITY is a bit like trying to keep an infectious disease at bay. Nasty software can spread swiftly to large populations, so it has to be identified quickly and information passed on immediately to ensure that others can protect themselves. Ideally, organisations should avoid catching an infection in the first place—but that requires them to get better at basic security hygiene.
                The story of the hackers who hit the bull’s eye at Target is revealing. They are thought to have broken into the computers of a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning firm that was a supplier to Target and had access to login details for the retailer’s systems. Once inside, the hackers were able to install malware on Target’s point-of-sale system that captured credit- and debit-card details at tills before the data were ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                IN THE HIGH desert some 50 miles west of Idaho Falls, the terrain is so rugged that the vehicle in which your correspondent was touring the facilities at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) ended up with two shredded tyres. Originally set up in the 1940s to test naval artillery, the high-security government lab now worries about weapons of a different kind. Some of its elite engineers help protect power grids, telecoms networks and other critical infrastructure in America against cyber-attacks and other threats.
                The lab boasts its own 61-mile (98km) electrical grid and seven substations. It also has a wireless network and an explosives test bed. These can all be used by government agencies and businesses to run experiments that would be hard or impossible to conduct in an operational setting. “There are not many places in the world where you can crash a power system without incident,” says Ron ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                ONE NIGHT IN April a couple in Ohio was woken by the sound of a man shouting, “Wake up, baby!” When the husband went to investigate, he found the noise was coming from a web-connected camera they had set up to monitor their young daughter while she slept. As he entered her bedroom, the camera rotated to face him and a string of obscenities poured forth.
                The webcam was made by a company called Foscam, and last year a family in Houston had a similar experience with one of their products. After that episode, Foscam urged users to upgrade the software on their devices and to make sure they had changed the factory-issued password. The couple in Ohio had not done so. The problem arose even though Foscam had taken all the right steps in response to the initial breach, which shows how hard it is to protect devices hooked up ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                Cyber-attackers have multiplied and become far more professional











                AT 2PM ON March 20th 2013 the hard drives of tens of thousands of computers in South Korea were suddenly wiped clean in a massive cyber-attack. The main targets were banks and news agencies. At first the assault looked like a case of cyber-vandalism. But as they probed deeper, the computer sleuths investigating it came to a different conclusion.
                The operation, which they dubbed “Dark Seoul”, had been carefully planned. The hackers had found their way into the targets’ systems a couple of months earlier and inserted the software needed to wipe drives. Just before the attack they added the code needed to trigger it. Looking at the methods the intruders used, the investigators from McAfee, a cyber-security firm, thought that the attack might have been carried out by a group of hackers known for targeting South Korean military information.

                But they could not be sure. Tracing the exact source of an ...&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                HEATHER ADKINS, THE head of Google’s security-incidents team, has what she calls a “monthly patch day”, when she updates the software running on all of the electronic devices in her home. If everybody were like Ms Adkins, cyber-security would be much less of a problem. But even with the best of intentions, people forget to update software, install antivirus programs and so on.
                The problem is that by weakening their own defences, they do not just make themselves more vulnerable to being hacked; they may also cause harm to other web users by making it possible, say, for an intruder surreptitiously to take over their device and use it to attack other computers. The same holds true in the corporate world.

                “HOW DO YOU protect what you want to exploit?” asks Scott Charney, an executive at Microsoft. He highlights a dilemma. Intelligence agencies look for programming mistakes in software so they can use them to spy on terrorists and other targets. But if they leave open these security holes, known in tech jargon as “vulnerabilities”, they run the risk that hostile hackers will also find and exploit them.
                Academics, security researchers and teams from software firms unearth hundreds of vulnerabilities each year. One recent discovery was the Heartbleed bug, a flaw in a widely used encryption system.
