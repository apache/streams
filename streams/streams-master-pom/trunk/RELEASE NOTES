Apache Streams (Incubating)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Apache Streams is be a lightweight server for ActivityStreams (activitystrea.ms). The role of Apache Streams is to provide a central point of aggregation, filtering and querying for Activities that have been submitted by disparate systems. Apache Streams also intends to include a mechanism for intelligent filtering and recommendation to reduce the noise to end users.


Apache Streams will bring together individuals who are or are looking to increase and centralize the production, consumption and federation of ActivityStreams throughout enterprise organizations and the Internet as a whole. The target features include:

Publication of Activities from multiple systems via HTTP
Aggregation and syndication of streams
Support for security trimming of streams by social graph
Noise reduction and intelligent filtering
Federation of streams across disparate systems
Provide libraries for easy integration in source systems

The ActivityStreams specification standardizes a generic format for describing event-based data. Many social web companies have adopted the format and it has been included in the OpenSocial specification as the preferred method for delivery of activity data. During discussions of ActivityStreams at OpenSocial events earlier in the year, it became clear that multiple organizations are facing similar issues as to the publication and filtering of their activities and would benefit from a commonly-developed, open-source ActivityStreams server.

The initial goal of the project is to survey donated code and develop a common, high-level architecture for an initial release. The project will then work toward that release in a new code base, pulling in pieces of donated code as necessary.
