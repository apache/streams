I decided to fix it when I realized I disliked my picture being taken. \n\nSo I started working out in August 2011, 5 days a week with no set program, terrible nutrition, and bad form. Over the next 6 months I found /r/fitness and other weightlifting sites and quickly improved my nutrition and started doing a split body workout. The next 6 months I started cutting weight and added leg workouts as well (had a nagging knee injury and had to fix computer guy posture).\n\n**Year 2**\n\nAfter my last post I tried bulking on purpose this time with a goal weight of 190lbs/86kg. I tried to gain about 1lb/.45kg a week while still eating the clean healthy food, but just more of it. I decided to keep the same general lifting routine since I had not plateaued. Additionally I started the 9-5 work life in Sept 2012 and it took a couple weeks to get my sleep, nutrition and gym rhythm back. I lift about 2 hours after my dinner (get to gym at 7-8pm) and it takes about 1.5-2 hours including the commute. I eventually hit my goal weight of 190lbs/86kg in February and then decided to do another slow cut to see what kind of progress I had made. I tried to cut weight slowly at about the same rate as I had gained it so I (hopefully) wouldn’t lose everything I gained from bulking. Besides a 10 day, eating everything, no gym vacation in July I stuck to the schedule and it worked out great! My main lifts didn’t drop off during my cut which was better than expected.\n\n**General Diet**\n\nI went by basic macros and not calories when keeping track of food. Since I eat the same things I just tweaked the amounts if I wasn’t gaining/losing weight at the right speeds. I eat 3 meals a day usually with room for 1 snack/protein shake if needed. If I absolutely had to go over my macros for a day I went over on protein. Seasonings don’t get counted and I only use sriracha or low calorie sauces. Stevia is my 0 calorie sweetener of choice.\n\n**Bulking Diet** \n\n45% protein 35% carbs 20% fats. Adjust food amounts to fit your calorie needs while still getting close to macro %’s\n\n**Breakfast**: medium/large bowl of rolled oats with almond butter + 5 eggs + large coffee (I add ON Vanilla Whey protein powder to hazelnut coffee for amazingness)\n\n**Lunch**: 1.5lbs/24oz of chicken/leaner beefs/fish + equal size portion of veggies (brassica type veggie preferred) + 80g of your favorite complex carb (brown rice, sweet potato, beans)\n\n**After work dinner**: Dinner is 1lb/16oz of chicken/beef + equal size portion of veggies + 80g of complex carbs again. \n\n**Snack if needed**: Make a shake that fits your needed macros for the day. If you struggle to eat a lot of meat/get enough protein try taking 0% fat plain greek yogurt and add lemon juice and 0 calorie sweetener for a delicious concoction. To cut the acidity try using lemon extract and lemon zest instead of juice. \n\n**Cutting Diet** \n\n50% protein 30% carbs 20% fats. Adjust food amounts to fit your calorie needs while still getting close to macro %’s\n\n**Breakfast**: small bowl of rolled oats + 2 eggs + large coffee (I add ON Vanilla Whey protein powder to hazelnut coffee)\n\n**Lunch**: 2/3lbs/12oz of chicken/leaner beefs/fish + equal size portion of veggies (brassica type veggie preferred) \n\n**After work dinner**: Dinner is 2/3lb/12oz of chicken/lean beef/fish + equal size portion of veggies + half of a small avocado or some other healthy fat. \n\n**Snack if needed**: 0% fat plain greek yogurt mixed with lemon juice, lemon extract, lemon zest and 0 calorie sweetener OR kimchee OR a spinach salad with a bit of goat cheese and balsamic OR seasoned seaweed sheets filled with dried baby shrimp/fish. (you can only pick one....)\n\n**Drinks**: Coffee, Green Tea, Water, Lemon Iced Tea \n\n**Supplements**: Creatine, ON Nutrition Whey protein (vanilla ice cream flavor &lt;3 still tastes like powdered unicorn), Fish Oil, Multivitamin, Vitamin D, Spirulina, Psycillium Husk, only when cutting EC stack and Yohimbine occasionally. Use Examine.com to learn more about these supplements\n\n**Workout Routine** \n\nThese are general standard workouts I do but I frequently swap various auxiliary lifts in and out of rotation all the time. I do lifts in 3 sets of 10-12 with medium weight or 3 sets of 10,8,6 with heavy weights. Usually I am close to failure by the end of 3rd set no matter what. Proper form is the main emphasis during all lifts. I try to increase the weight or # of reps each week or just the difficulty and ROM in general. I do cardio 2-3 times a week when cutting and it consists of incline walking or cycling or stairmaster for 10-15 minutes total at moderate pace. 5-10 sets of HIIT sprints occasionally when I can talk myself into it. I only need a coffee occasionally to get me ready for the gym.\n\n**Day1** Chest/Abs\n\nDB incline flies\n\nDB flat bench flies\n\nDB incline bench press\n\nDB flat bench press\n\nCable Flies from top, middle, and bottom angles.\n\nWide-grip bench or dips if still energetic\n\nWeighted Leg raises\n\nWeighted cable crunches\n\nPlanks\n\n**Day2** Back\n\nWeighted pull-ups wide-grip\n\nWeighted pull-ups parallel-grip\n\nWeighted chin-ups\n\nDeadlifts (rep range of only 4-8)\n\nStanding cable pullover close-grip\n\nCable pullover wide-grip\n\nT-bar rows\n\nWide-grip seated row\n\nUn-weighted pull-ups if still energetic\n\n**Day3** Shoulders/arms\n\nFront and Side DB raises\n\nStanding OHP\n\nCable raises with single arm grip (front and side)\n\nStanding one arm shoulder press (use T-bar row equipment but facing it)\n\nFace pulls\n\nRear delt Flies\n\nHammer or concentration curls\n\nEZ bar bicep curls with different grip each set (6 or 9 sets)\n\nSkullcrushers with close-grip bench supersets using a close-grip with the EZ bar\n\nTricep rope pushdowns\n\nAlso some extra light stabilization work/lifts for my shoulder joints/rotator cuff\n\n**Day4** Legs/Abs\n\nSquats high bar (I end with a widowmaker set as well) \n\nMachine leg extension\n\nMachine single leg extension\n\nMachine leg curl\n\nLying leg curl\n\nLeg press \n\nLeg press calf raises\n\nCalf raises\n\nWeighted hip thrust (do these in a corner as they look terribly awkward) \n\nSame abs lifts as day1\n\n**Day5** Check how your body is feeling and pick accordingly\n\nRest or light cardio with a lagging bodypart/muscle workout\n\n**Extra Stuff**\n\nI did not do SS due to already having basic strength level when I learned about it. I do highly recommend it to anyone starting lifting weights for the first time as it provides a solid foundation. \n\nMy tattoos have not noticeably changed in size or proportions. From last post to this post my waist size went from a 31 to a 33-34 and back down to a 32-31. For t-shirt size I used to be able to wear most medium shirts. By the end of my bulk I could only wear larges and now I currently can wear only looser neck mediums and smaller larges. \n\nI drank a bit less than once a week while bulking and usually was 4 or so strong drinks over 5+ hours to reach and keep a good level. When cutting I drink about twice a month and only 2-3 strong drinks is needed to reach the same level. For tracking lifts and food I suggest using Fitocracy and/or Myfitnesspal. I used Fitocracy for 4-5 months but realized I was doing more of the social stuff and wasting time than tracking my lifts so I stopped. \n\nFor goals I still have not reached a lean 180lb/81kg but now I want to be a lean 185lb/84kg. I hit the 1000lb club and now want to reach the 1250lb club and/or 400 wilks score. I still don’t have a bicep vein and really want one. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions or suggestions for me. Are there any areas that need work and I hope this is helpful to someone!","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":"Highland Games","media":null,"clicked":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my second year progress post to follow my first year one &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/wgicu/1_year_progress_pics/\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Info and Stats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am 5&amp;#39;11 and 24 years old in a few weeks.

I do lifts in 3 sets of 10-12 with medium weight or 3 sets of 10,8,6 with heavy weights. Usually I am close to failure by the end of 3rd set no matter what. Proper form is the main emphasis during all lifts. I try to increase the weight or # of reps each week or just the difficulty and ROM in general. I do cardio 2-3 times a week when cutting and it consists of incline walking or cycling or stairmaster for 10-15 minutes total at moderate pace. 5-10 sets of HIIT sprints occasionally when I can talk myself into it. I only need a coffee occasionally to get me ready for the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day1&lt;/strong&gt; Chest/Abs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DB incline flies&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DB flat bench flies&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DB incline bench press&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DB flat bench press&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cable Flies from top, middle, and bottom angles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wide-grip bench or dips if still energetic&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weighted Leg raises&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weighted cable crunches&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Planks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day2&lt;/strong&gt; Back&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weighted pull-ups wide-grip&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weighted pull-ups parallel-grip&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weighted chin-ups&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deadlifts (rep range of only 4-8)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standing cable pullover close-grip&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cable pullover wide-grip&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T-bar rows&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wide-grip seated row&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Un-weighted pull-ups if still energetic&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day3&lt;/strong&gt; Shoulders/arms&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Front and Side DB raises&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standing OHP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cable raises with single arm grip (front and side)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standing one arm shoulder press (use T-bar row equipment but facing it)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Face pulls&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rear delt Flies&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hammer or concentration curls&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EZ bar bicep curls with different grip each set (6 or 9 sets)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skullcrushers with close-grip bench supersets using a close-grip with the EZ bar&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tricep rope pushdowns&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also some extra light stabilization work/lifts for my shoulder joints/rotator cuff&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day4&lt;/strong&gt; Legs/Abs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Squats high bar (I end with a widowmaker set as well) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Machine leg extension&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Machine single leg extension&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Machine leg curl&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lying leg curl&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leg press &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leg press calf raises&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calf raises&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weighted hip thrust (do these in a corner as they look terribly awkward) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same abs lifts as day1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day5&lt;/strong&gt; Check how your body is feeling and pick accordingly&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rest or light cardio with a lagging bodypart/muscle workout&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not do SS due to already having basic strength level when I learned about it. I do highly recommend it to anyone starting lifting weights for the first time as it provides a solid foundation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My tattoos have not noticeably changed in size or proportions. From last post to this post my waist size went from a 31 to a 33-34 and back down to a 32-31. For t-shirt size I used to be able to wear most medium shirts. By the end of my bulk I could only wear larges and now I currently can wear only looser neck mediums and smaller larges. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drank a bit less than once a week while bulking and usually was 4 or so strong drinks over 5+ hours to reach and keep a good level. When cutting I drink about twice a month and only 2-3 strong drinks is needed to reach the same level. For tracking lifts and food I suggest using Fitocracy and/or Myfitnesspal. I used Fitocracy for 4-5 months but realized I was doing more of the social stuff and wasting time than tracking my lifts so I stopped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For goals I still have not reached a lean 180lb/81kg but now I want to be a lean 185lb/84kg. I hit the 1000lb club and now want to reach the 1250lb club and/or 400 wilks score. I still don’t have a bicep vein and really want one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for me. Are there any areas that need work and I hope this is helpful to someone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","media_embed":{},"score":20,"saved":false,"num_reports":null,"created":1377900002.0,"downs":3,"hidden":false,"likes":null,"subreddit":"Fitness"}

Il existe plusieurs cellules, la plus connue étant celle de Montréal. Ici, l'on parle de la cellule de la Rive-Sud, centrée près de Longueuil, et les environs.\n\n**C'est quoi ça un Kabaret?**\n\nTout simple, c'est un évènement d'une fin de semaine, ou plusieurs personnes aimant faire du cinéma se réunissent et travaillent tous ensemble pour réaliser plusieurs projet. C'est un bouillonnement de créativité, d'imagination, de création. Il y a autant des gens qui travaillent dans le domaine que des gens qui viennent s'y initier. C'est dans un grand esprit de camaraderie, les gens s'entraident, travaillent en équipe, partagent.\n\n**C'est ouvert à tous?**\n\nC'est ouvert à tous, oui. Pas besoin d'être membre de la cellule de la Rive-Sud, ou d'une autre cellule quelle qu'elle soit. Certains découvrent même Kino lors de cette occasion! Même pas besoin d'être de la région, moi même je suis de Lanaudière et j'y participe.\n\n**C'est quoi les \"pré-requis?\"**\n\nIl n'y a pas de pré-requis, réellement. Pas besoin d'expérience ou de connaissances particulières. Bien sûr, pour filmer vos projets et les monter, vaut mieux avoir son matériel, mais dès qu'une caméra peut filmer et un ordinateur monter, vous êtes en affaire! Il y a des tas de gens sur place pour vous aider, et vous aurez la chance de participer à tout plein de projets intéressants.\n\n**C'est quoi les heures?**\n\nEn fait, plus que des heures, ça se passe en fait du vendredi 30 août à 17h00 jusqu'au lundi 2 septembre vers les environs de 20h, où se commence la projection des films tournés la fin de semaine. On parle d'un total d'un peu plus de 72h.\n\n**Ça coûte de quoi?**\n\nOui, 35$.\n\n**Ben là, ça vient avec quoi?**\n\nPremièrement, tous les repas pour la fin de semaine, du vendredi soir jusqu'au lundi soir. T'as aussi les collations et autres, les breuvages, la liqueur, name it. Popcorn aussi. On a la chance d'avoir ça, une machine à popcorn sur les lieux, roulant à peu près 18h par jour. Sinon, y'a la salle, que l'on surnomme Kinolab, où tout le matériel est placé pour les tournages et le montage, il y a aussi des zones réservées pour ce qui est de dormir (qui est assez bonne franquette, amené votre sac de couchage et votre matelas de sol, un lit de camp aussi c'est bon), les douches, tout ça. Nogé, lourris, logé, nourris. Sinon, la bière est pas fournie, mais elle est à 2$. Moins cher qu'au bar quand t'es pas le mardi.\n\n**Ah ok. Autre chose à savoir?**\n\nEuh... Moi même j'me demande, j'pense avoir fait le tour. Sinon, il y a quand même la projection le lundi soir, vers 20h (à prendre avec +ou- 15min, surtout +) qui est ouverte à tous, contribution volontaire. Je conseillerais quand même d'éviter les enfants trop trop jeunes, parfois c'est cru, surtout en deuxième partie.\n\nAh et aussi, si ça change de quoi, la bière c'est de la boréale.\n\n**L'adresse c'est?**\n\nC'est à la Salle paroissiale Sainte Famille, dans l'idyllique vieux Boucherville, au 539 rue Notre-Dame (J4B 3P3). La salle ouvre généralement vers 15h, pour accueillir ceux qui arrivent tôt.\n\n**Vous avez des liens?**\n\n[Oui, un site web pour l'évènement \\(qui reprendra beaucoup pour vous ce que j'ai dis ici mais qui possède un embedded google maps pour les indications\\)](http://www.kinors.com/kabaret/) \n\n[Une page d'évènement Facebook \\(toujours drôle\\)](https://www.facebook.com/events/678574408836861/)\n\nTL;DR : Si tu sais pas quoi faire de ta fin de semaine, 35$ j't'arrange de quoi. Tu vas avoir du plaisir facque viens.\n\nPour moi, Kino c'est particulièrement important. Ça fait maintenant 6 ans que je m'implique dans différentes cellules, et 4 ans que je participe au Kabaret de Kino Rive-Sud, et chaque fois c'est unique et génial. C'est un peu comme l'excitation que j'avais à Noël quand j'étais enfant. Donc voilà, si cet évènement interpelle certains d'entre-vous, vous êtes invités et les bienvenus. Ne vous privez pas de votre plaisir, ce sera une fin de semaine incroyable que vous aurez.\n\nSi vous ne pouvez pas participer, il y aura toujours la soirée de projection.

Il y a des tas de gens sur place pour vous aider, et vous aurez la chance de participer à tout plein de projets intéressants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;#39;est quoi les heures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;En fait, plus que des heures, ça se passe en fait du vendredi 30 août à 17h00 jusqu&amp;#39;au lundi 2 septembre vers les environs de 20h, où se commence la projection des films tournés la fin de semaine. On parle d&amp;#39;un total d&amp;#39;un peu plus de 72h.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ça coûte de quoi?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oui, 35$.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben là, ça vient avec quoi?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Premièrement, tous les repas pour la fin de semaine, du vendredi soir jusqu&amp;#39;au lundi soir. T&amp;#39;as aussi les collations et autres, les breuvages, la liqueur, name it. Popcorn aussi. On a la chance d&amp;#39;avoir ça, une machine à popcorn sur les lieux, roulant à peu près 18h par jour. Sinon, y&amp;#39;a la salle, que l&amp;#39;on surnomme Kinolab, où tout le matériel est placé pour les tournages et le montage, il y a aussi des zones réservées pour ce qui est de dormir (qui est assez bonne franquette, amené votre sac de couchage et votre matelas de sol, un lit de camp aussi c&amp;#39;est bon), les douches, tout ça. Nogé, lourris, logé, nourris. Sinon, la bière est pas fournie, mais elle est à 2$. Moins cher qu&amp;#39;au bar quand t&amp;#39;es pas le mardi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah ok. Autre chose à savoir?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Euh... Moi même j&amp;#39;me demande, j&amp;#39;pense avoir fait le tour. Sinon, il y a quand même la projection le lundi soir, vers 20h (à prendre avec +ou- 15min, surtout +) qui est ouverte à tous, contribution volontaire. Je conseillerais quand même d&amp;#39;éviter les enfants trop trop jeunes, parfois c&amp;#39;est cru, surtout en deuxième partie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ah et aussi, si ça change de quoi, la bière c&amp;#39;est de la boréale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L&amp;#39;adresse c&amp;#39;est?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C&amp;#39;est à la Salle paroissiale Sainte Famille, dans l&amp;#39;idyllique vieux Boucherville, au 539 rue Notre-Dame (J4B 3P3). La salle ouvre généralement vers 15h, pour accueillir ceux qui arrivent tôt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vous avez des liens?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.kinors.com/kabaret/\"&gt;Oui, un site web pour l&amp;#39;évènement (qui reprendra beaucoup pour vous ce que j&amp;#39;ai dis ici mais qui possède un embedded google maps pour les indications)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/678574408836861/\"&gt;Une page d&amp;#39;évènement Facebook (toujours drôle)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : Si tu sais pas quoi faire de ta fin de semaine, 35$ j&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;arrange de quoi.

Rather than attempt to answer all of these at once, I decided to at least start with the most common one I have heard: that Stockton would not have had other worldly assist numbers without Malone as the finisher on pick and rolls.\n\nI am by no means trying to make this the definitive answer to this two decade long question, and want to get some caveats to everything I'm about to write out of the way now:\n\n1. There are limited advanced statistics from Stockton and Malone's prime years, or at least, I am struggling to find them. Some of the most useful for answering this question, like the number of pick and rolls that were run, percentage of baskets assisted, and overall league numbers pertaining to those two things during that era, as well as accurate on/off numbers or even how much time Malone and Stockton DID NOT share on the court. As such, I am working with what I can.\n2. Because of the above, I am forced to make some logical (in my opinion) leaps and assumptions about the vicinity of those stats that may or may not have a semblance of accuracy.\n3. Since there is no data analyzing to whom and how often Stockton passed, I did not feel comfortable making precise assumptions about how many of his assists went to each player and instead played it on the safe side for the sake of the critics (this will be covered below).\n4. When analyzing what the Jazz would do without Malone, I did not bother to add additional usage rates to other members of the Jazz. While this would inevitably happen, it is impossible to say who would receive the largest bumps and how it would affect efficiency so I purposely left it out because I didn't think I could make anyone totally happy.\n5. When evaluating league-wide stats compared to Malone's, I used the arbitrary search limitations (via BR) of C-F's, F's, C's, and F-C's that started at least 41 games. I used this because I saw it as necessary to assume Malone's replacement and competition would be  starting caliber bigmen (its logical to assume he wouldn't play against or be replaced by below average bigs) and that group seemed to fit the bill the best. However I recognize that there are some weird outliers (like Larry Bird) who aren't the best comp's but it was the best I could find. Also, since fg% was a factor, I feel obligated to point out that some of the players in this data set shot threes, which lower overall fg% (unless your Curry or Korver), and are an extremely unlikely result as a roll man in a PnR, but the average 3's per minute attempted by this group was extremely low, and I deemed them insignificant noise, but they are noise all the same.\n6. Everyone must understand that the Jazz at this time were running the pick and roll largely IN SPITE of the rest of the league. It was considered an outdated offense that wasn't adapted by the rest of the league until the 2000's (it is now the most common play run in the half court set, and by a wide margin). As such, many speculate that the Jazz had an advantage because pick and roll defenses were much less refined and practiced than they are now, so players within the Jazz's system would see a boost in production/efficiency. There is some evidence supporting this, but it isn't conclusive and I did not assume this because of that.\n7. On a similar note, there is no way to say whether the lethality of the Stockton to Malone duo helped draw in double teams and thus opened easier dishes, and consequently assists to outside shooters or bigs under the basket. I do not take this into account because of that, as well as I think it is fair to assume many of those assists would have come from Malone after the double team hit him which would not affect Stockton's assist numbers, as well as there are often double teams even in PnR's with lesser players than Malone.\n\nThe longevity of Stockton and Malone makes this even harder to answer because there are so many years to analyze. I could average their prime years, do the equations to convert them into advanced stats and go from there, but frankly I am a college student without that much time and patience and their ridiculous longevity also calls into question exactly what would be considered their \"prime\". Because of this, I chose a single year that I determined to be the best average year for both of them within their \"prime\". The year I chose was 1991-1992, a solid year for both Stockton and Malone, but neither had a career high in any relevant stat to his question, and at the same time it wasn't close to any career low.\n\nIn 1991-1992, Stockton averaged 13.7 assists. Malone averaged 28 points on 9.9 (is it fair to call that 10?) made field goals a game. In order to understand how many of those \"10\" field goals were assisted, we have to look at modern day equivalents since that data is not available before 06-07 (if this data exists PLEASE tell me where). In order to find a similar number, I looked at modern day bigs who had high usage rates, played with a good passing point guard, and ran the pick and roll a lot (I also looked for players with similar skill sats and roles as Malone). Some of the players I used to help you get a feel were (in no order, according to Hoopdata): Amare in 10-11 (ran the PnR with Felton [he was decent that year ok?] a ton. 52.6% assisted), Amare again in 06-07 (dat PnR wit Nash, 64.9% assisted), Scola 10-11 (ran it with Lowry. 64.3 assisted), Boozer in 09-10 &amp; 10-11 (ran it with Deron, then with Rose. Interestingly went from 74.2% assisted to 64.7% assisted), Blake Griffin in 12-13 (with Chris Paul, 64.1% assisted), and David West in 10-11 (with Chris Paul, 60% assisted). I looked at some other examples as well, but you get the gist, teams with a good pick and roll duo, who ran the pick and roll a lot, generally had a roll guy with an average assist percentage of approximately 64% (As an interesting aside, starting bigs actually seem to have a higher percentage of their baskets assisted when they are not in a pick and roll heavy offense or are not the primary roll man, the league average for PF's was closer to 66-67%, not what I would have expected). I have often heard that many teams in the current era of the NBA run the PnR even more than the Jazz did in the 90's, but there is no way to prove this aside from me watching film and counting pick and rolls, so let's assume the assist percentage translates somewhat accurately. Let's say that Malone had 64% of his baskets assisted. \n\nIt is safe to assume that not 100% of Malone's assisted baskets came from Stockton, but it IS safe to assume it was the vast majority, and since there is no number I could pull that wouldn't be 100% guesswork, we are going to assume that Stockton was indeed responsible for all of Malone's assisted baskets, just to stop the haters (that's a joke). So that means 6.4 baskets to Malone were Stockton assists, and 4.6 weren't. \n\nLet's assume then that Malone got traded to another team early in his career (heaven forbid!) for an average starting power forward ([this is the list I used for the upcoming analysis btw](http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;year_min=1992&amp;year_max=1992&amp;franch_id=&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;birth_country=&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;is_as=&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;qual=&amp;c1stat=gs&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=41&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;c5stat=&amp;c5comp=gt&amp;c6mult=1.0&amp;c6stat=&amp;order_by=ts_pct)). In 91-92, the average big shot 49%, compared to Malone's 52.6%. The average big also had a usage rate of 19.7%, compared to Malone's leading 30.3%. The average turnover rate for starting bigs was 12.9%, surprisingly Malone's was only 11.6%. Let's assume that the Jazz's primary PnR man is exactly average, and that the Jazz still stick with a PnR based offense (Sloan is still the coach, so we can be pretty sure of this), so 64% of his baskets are assisted. We'll also assume this player absorbs all of Malone's minutes (37.7 per game is a lot, but then again, back then starters played more minutes. 17 bigs in 91-92 played over 37 mpg, this year only 14 players total averaged that much). This average player would make about 6.3 buckets a game. This means 4 (4.032) of those a game would be assists from Stockton (sticking with the \"Stockton makes ALL the assists\" assumption [reeeeal bad meme reference]). \n\nDoing the simple math gets us to our conclusion: Stockton would average less assists a game, dropping from 13.7 assists to about 11.3 assists per game. This is a significant drop, but still outstanding assist numbers, especially with the understanding that there would be an additional 7-8 shot attempts to be disbursed in Malone's absence, some of those probably resulting in additional Stockton assists. \n\nIn summary, Stockton would at LEAST average 11.3 assists in our 1991-1992 isolated example, and if you assume that 1991-1992 is a good indicator for the entire Stockton-Malone era, Stockton would have ended his career with somewhere between 12,200 and 12,800 assists (depending on minutes for him and the replacement player[s]). He would have had at least 6 seasons of double digit assists. This means he would still be the all-time assist leader (by a smallish margin), and in all likelihood still considered a top 5 point guard of all time. Again, this is all WITHOUT counting those left over possessions in Malone's absence. Given that Stockton dished an assist on 14.3% of all the Jazz's possessions in 1991-1992, if we include those possessions in the discussion then Stockton probably averages just over 1 assist more per game, which seems small but brings his average that year to 12.3 assists. Career wise that would mean he dishes between 13,500 and 14,200 assists, still giving him a very large lead in the record books and would mean he likely still holds at least 4 of the top 10 assists per game seasons (although no longer the top spot). \n\nBasically, John Stockton was a beast of a point guard with or without Malone. Malone's absence would have been a significant hit to Stockton's production but he would still put up otherworldly assist numbers.\n\nThe real question might be: What would Stockton be without the Pick and Roll? The world may never know...\n\nPlease give me feedback and criticism, I love hearing feedback about two of my idols whether its positive or negative. \n\n","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":"[UTA] Enes Kanter","media":null,"clicked":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post was spurred by another post about unbreakable records, people seemed interested in this discussion so hopefully you like it and it will spur other ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a lifelong and die hard jazz fan, I have always heard people argue whether Malone was great because of Stockton or whether Stockton was great because of Malone, or whether both would have had similar production even without a legend as their pick and roll partner.

So that means 6.4 baskets to Malone were Stockton assists, and 4.6 weren&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume then that Malone got traded to another team early in his career (heaven forbid!) for an average starting power forward (&lt;a href=\"http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;type=totals&amp;amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;amp;year_min=1992&amp;amp;year_max=1992&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;height_min=0&amp;amp;height_max=99&amp;amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;is_as=&amp;amp;as_comp=gt&amp;amp;as_val=&amp;amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;amp;qual=&amp;amp;c1stat=gs&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=41&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;c5stat=&amp;amp;c5comp=gt&amp;amp;c6mult=1.0&amp;amp;c6stat=&amp;amp;order_by=ts_pct\"&gt;this is the list I used for the upcoming analysis btw&lt;/a&gt;). In 91-92, the average big shot 49%, compared to Malone&amp;#39;s 52.6%. The average big also had a usage rate of 19.7%, compared to Malone&amp;#39;s leading 30.3%. The average turnover rate for starting bigs was 12.9%, surprisingly Malone&amp;#39;s was only 11.6%. Let&amp;#39;s assume that the Jazz&amp;#39;s primary PnR man is exactly average, and that the Jazz still stick with a PnR based offense (Sloan is still the coach, so we can be pretty sure of this), so 64% of his baskets are assisted. We&amp;#39;ll also assume this player absorbs all of Malone&amp;#39;s minutes (37.7 per game is a lot, but then again, back then starters played more minutes. 17 bigs in 91-92 played over 37 mpg, this year only 14 players total averaged that much). This average player would make about 6.3 buckets a game. This means 4 (4.032) of those a game would be assists from Stockton (sticking with the &amp;quot;Stockton makes ALL the assists&amp;quot; assumption [reeeeal bad meme reference]). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing the simple math gets us to our conclusion: Stockton would average less assists a game, dropping from 13.7 assists to about 11.3 assists per game. This is a significant drop, but still outstanding assist numbers, especially with the understanding that there would be an additional 7-8 shot attempts to be disbursed in Malone&amp;#39;s absence, some of those probably resulting in additional Stockton assists. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, Stockton would at LEAST average 11.3 assists in our 1991-1992 isolated example, and if you assume that 1991-1992 is a good indicator for the entire Stockton-Malone era, Stockton would have ended his career with somewhere between 12,200 and 12,800 assists (depending on minutes for him and the replacement player[s]). He would have had at least 6 seasons of double digit assists. This means he would still be the all-time assist leader (by a smallish margin), and in all likelihood still considered a top 5 point guard of all time. Again, this is all WITHOUT counting those left over possessions in Malone&amp;#39;s absence. Given that Stockton dished an assist on 14.3% of all the Jazz&amp;#39;s possessions in 1991-1992, if we include those possessions in the discussion then Stockton probably averages just over 1 assist more per game, which seems small but brings his average that year to 12.3 assists. Career wise that would mean he dishes between 13,500 and 14,200 assists, still giving him a very large lead in the record books and would mean he likely still holds at least 4 of the top 10 assists per game seasons (although no longer the top spot). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, John Stockton was a beast of a point guard with or without Malone. Malone&amp;#39;s absence would have been a significant hit to Stockton&amp;#39;s production but he would still put up otherworldly assist numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real question might be: What would Stockton be without the Pick and Roll? The world may never know...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please give me feedback and criticism, I love hearing feedback about two of my idols whether its positive or negative. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","media_embed":{},"score":63,"saved":false,"num_reports":null,"created":1377828823.0,"downs":12,"hidden":false,"likes":null,"subreddit":"nba"}

Unfortunately none of [my pictures](http://imgur.com/a/krid1) really capture the full extent of what's going on, but I'm currently experiencing dryness all over my entire face (which I've never had before - I've always been more normal-oily and prone to [fairly minor] breakouts) that feels quite literally scale-y, especially under my eyes and around my nose. I still have a lot of residual redness, and have a ton of very tiny whiteheads all over my face (these I have had before, but were always limited to my chin and the corners of my mouth, and certainly not to the extent that I have them now).

At max throttle, they will output a percentage of the listed max thrust (in the VAB) based on the velocity of the ship. This ''curve'' is defined at several points based on parameters in the part .cfg file, and should be considered when picking what jets to use on your ship.\n\n**VELOCITY**\n\nFor the stock turbojet, the values are as follows:\n&gt; velocityCurve\n\t\n\t\tkey = 0 0.5 0 0\n\t\tkey = 1000 1 0 0\n\t\tkey = 2000 0.5 0 0\n\t\tkey = 2400 0 0 0\n\t\n\nAs you can see, the jet produces max thrust at 1000 m/s, and 0 thrust at 2400 m/s. This makes it useful for high speed cruising/ssto design. Furthermore, a quick test I ran gave me an output of 170 ish kn of thrust at 500 m/s, which is 75% of 225, and thus it seems that the scaling on this ''curve'' is in fact linear between the points designated.\n\nThe normal stock jet, meanwhile, looks like this:\n&gt;velocityCurve\n\t\n\t\tkey = 1000 0 0 0\n\t\tkey = 850 0.2 0 0\n\t\tkey = 0 1 0 0\n\t\n\nAs you can see, this jet is designed for lower speed, and indeed has a far lower thrust:mass ratio at max thrust than the turbojet (150:1 compared to 187.5:1). However, it should theoretically make up for this by being more fuel efficient at high pressure (i.e. low altitude).\n\nIf we ignore efficiency for the moment, and simply graph the two in terms of thrust:mass ratio and velocity, it turns out that the equivalence point (past which turbojets are more powerful in all situations) happens at 239.4 m/s. 239 m/s is reaaaaaally slow, and so in cases where speed is the objective, the turbojets are going to be more effective than the standard jets.\n\n**EFFICIENCY**\n\nOf course, this doesn't factor in efficiency. From the information in the VAB, it would appear that turbojets have an isp far lower than standard jets, as they range from only 800-1200. This data is misleading, however, as there is yet another 'curve' parameter in the .cfg that controls isp relative to atmospheric pressure. \n\nThe curve for the turbojet is as follows:\n&gt;atmosphereCurve\n \t\n\t\tkey = 0 1200\n\t\tkey = 0.3 2500\n\t\tkey = 1 800\n\t\n\nand for the normal jet:\n&gt;atmosphereCurve\n\t\n\t\tkey = 0 1000\n\t\tkey = 0.3 1800\n\t\tkey = 1 2000\n \t\n\nAs you can see, while the normal jet gets less efficient the higher you are, turbojets actually get *more* efficient, until 0.3 atm (6020m, based on the equation for kerbin's atmo density on the wiki), before becoming less efficient as you get closer to vac. as they end up at 1200 isp in vac compared to the normal jet's 1000, it follows that after the you get high enough for the turbojet to become more efficient than the normal jet, it stays that way. This first intersection happens at 0.557 atm, which is only 2900m of altitude. Any higher than this, and turbojets are more efficient than normal jets.\n\n**TO SUM UP**\n\nAs you can see, in basically all situations, the turbojets are better than the normal jets. The same sort of analysis can be performed on mod parts, as all the info is in their part .cfg's. This also gives you an option if you really like a part's model or idea but think it's op - you can just modify the part .cfg until its stats line up with what you feel is balanced/realistic.\n\nTLDR: Basically, never use the normal jets.

Rules! Rules!**\n\n1. US only. Sorry, but international shipping is eugh :(\n\n2. I will *not* be redistributing product within the boxes. What's in the box is in the box. If you win a box and don't want something in it, you're welcome to tell me and I'll remove the item. But no mix and match. If you don't like the boxes, don't enter.\n\n3. One box per person. When you enter the contest, please list the three boxes in order of most wanted to least wanted. First winner gets their first pick. Second winner gets their first pick that isn't taken. Third winner gets the box that remains. If you are only interested in one or two boxes, you can choose to only list one or two, but you must explicitly specify that you *do not want* the other(s). If you are selected as a winner, but the box(es) you listed were already taken, I'll move onto a runner-up who was less particular.\n\n4. You must have a valid street address. No PO/FPO/APO/DPO.\n\n5. No lurkers (I know, ironic) and/or new (&lt;30 day) accounts. I *will* check your comment history.\n\n---\n\n**Ok, what do I have to do?**\n\nMake food. Take a picture of it. Post the picture alongside a description of what it is. Describe your dish to us. What does it taste like? How does it smell? What kind of texture does it have? Get creative here. Recipe is optional. I'm not necessarily looking for the most tasty *looking* dish; I'm looking for the combination of picture and dish that makes me go OMG GIVE IT TO ME NOW. Yes: this is a very subjective contest. I have no criteria for meal or ingredients; however, it must be a singular dish. You may garnish, but I'm not looking for Steak + Potatoes + Beans + Wine + Candles. Show me the steak on a plate, and then tell me about it. Seriously. I'm hungry!\n\n**The deadline for entries will be Wednesday, September 4th at 11:59 PM. I will announce winners by Friday morning.**\n\n*Edit: Changed the deadline so people had more time to plan and cook.*","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"media":null,"clicked":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2vigj","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey ladies (and men.)

The visual value is easy to communicate, just pull up your shirt and let her see your glorious abs. Non-visual value needs a little more finesse to demonstrate.\n\nBefore going on, it'll be helpful to have read the article on [Atomic Game](http://stopbetashit.com/?page_id=38). To communicate value you need to believe you have value, and it really helps if you actually have value.\n\n**Show, Don’t Tell**\n\nThe key to demonstrating value (other than having value and believing in yourself) is a concept well known to writers: Show, don’t tell. The way this has typically been explained in the community is “a rich man doesn’t need to say that he’s rich.”\n\nTelling someone your good traits (awesome job, your shiny car, how you can run a marathon, or how your ex GF was really hot) just makes them think you’re insecure. If you were confident, you wouldn’t feel the need to tell people how great you are. It’s also just not at all convincing. Attraction is a feeling, not a reasoned weighing of the facts.\n\nShowing your value on the other hand, that’s powerful. If you tell a girl that you’re really funny, she’ll think you’re just weird and suck at conversation. If you make her laugh, she’ll think you’re funny. Tell her about your awesome friends and she’ll wonder why you aren’t hanging out with them. Show up to the club with your awesome friends and let everyone see you having a good time, and she’ll think you’re a cool, popular guy.\n\n**Social Proof**\n\nSocial proof is when you have other people vouch for you being an attractive, quality guy. Again, not telling, but showing. When you go to a bar with a group of friends and you are all joking with each other, have a lot of energy, and are having a good time, that’s social proof. If you were a loser, you wouldn’t be out with a bunch of cool dudes having fun, therefor everyone who sees your group knows you’re not a loser.\n\nHanging out with women, especially attractive women, is even better. Why would attractive women hang out with you if you were a low value loser? They wouldn’t. Even if you’re not a very good looking guy, women will assume you must have something else going for you if you can keep the attention of women.\n\nIf you’re sarging solo, social proof can be harder. In fact, if you’re out alone people may assume that it’s because you don’t have any friends, and so you end up with negative value. To overcome this, start chatting up people as soon as you arrive. Guys, girls, doesn’t matter. Be friendly to everyone. A girl who sees you talking to a couple guys doesn’t know that you just met them. Now you’ve got social proof.\n\nFor sarging solo, you’ll also want to consider doing more day game. It’s normal to be in a bookstore or cafe by yourself, so being alone in that setting doesn’t come with any negative assumptions.\n\n**Confidence**\n\nConfidence is a bit of an odd thing because it’s both a demonstration of value and an actual value itself. We like confident people, they’re just more fun to be around than people who are shy, timid, and never want to go out and have an adventure. But it’s also a way of demonstrating a generalized high value.\n\nPeople are shit at judging value in a vacuum, so we look for clues. As I’ve said, social proof is one clue. Another big clue though is someone’s opinion of himself. No one has greater information about your value than yourself. You’re biased, but you’re also the world’s foremost expert.\n\nIf you act like a beta, show no confidence, and are always apologizing just for taking up space in the world, people will assume this is because you actually are low value. After all, would a really cool high value guy present himself as a piece of shit loser? Andy Kaufman aside, no way. So if you act like a loser it must be because you are one. Girls won’t waste their time trying to tell if your opinion of yourself is wrong.\n\nIt works the same way with being alpha.If you act like you’re an alpha people are very likely to believe you. There’s plenty of reasons to think you’d lie about being alpha, but that’s why I said people believe you when you act alpha. It’s hard to lie through actions, so when you act confident people will assume you have something to be confident in.\n\nConfidence is also a form of guerrilla social proof. If you approach a girl with confidence and are comfortable talking to her, she will assume that talking to girls is something you do all the time. She hasn’t seen you with girls, but she’ll believe your life is filled with them.\n\nGetting confidence is the trick though, and there is no magic bullet fix. Working on actually having value will help (Atomic Game), so will doing an honest assessment of your value (Inner Game). But while you’re working on that other stuff, just give yourself a little bit of positive self-talk, take a deep breath, jump in and remember that simply acting confident gives you some value. The ability to approach a stranger is a rare and admirable trait, so at a bare minimum you have that going for you.\n\n**Dancing Monkey Syndrome**\n\nYou just delivered your opener perfectly, dropped some really funny jokes, everyone laughed a lot, and then you did a couple magic tricks and the set is completely blown away. Too bad you’ve about to be blown out.\n\nYou’ve contracted Dancing Monkey Syndrome. You’re telling the set you opened that you’re there to entertain them. You might be entertaining, but you’re not attracting them — you’re showing them the desperate lengths you go to just to keep their attention. Opening a complete stranger with a funny joke shows confidence. Continuing the laugh parade shows a lack of confidence.\n\nDancing Monkey Syndrome is also incredibly impersonal. You can tell the same jokes the exact same way to someone completely different than the girl you’re talking to, and she knows it. Someone else could also tell her the same joke. There’s absolutely no connection between you. You want to be engaging and interesting, not merely entertaining. If all she wanted was entertainment, there’s always comedy specials on HBO.\n\n**When Showing Isn’t an Option**\n\nShow, Don’t Tell is the general rule, but showing isn’t always feasible. You’re not going to ask a girl to wait around for a couple hours while you complete a marathon, odds are the bar kitchen isn’t going to invite you back to show off your skills, and while you can show wealth by spending freely that tends to come across as try-hard and actually pretty insecure about all your other traits. So what does that leave? Telling. Fortunately, there are a couple tricks to make telling your good qualities a lot more effective.\n\nI love to cook, and not just because I like eating, though that’s a nice fringe benefit. What I really like about it is the creative process and the experimentation. You take a bunch of ingredients and transform them into something completely different. And then you do it again and again and over time the recipes slowly evolve and you branch out and experiment. You learn the way different flavors interact, often in really surprising ways, like how a really simple peach glaze takes on a complex, three dimensional flavor when you add just a little bit of dijon mustard. Every time you have one of those little moments where you see a new way of combining ingredients that experience goes into this sort of mental file cabinet that you can draw from in the future, so you’re not just transforming the food — you’re transforming the way you see and think about food. Plus, you know, there’s also the food itself, and you get to eat it. So there’s that.\n\nReading that, you probably think that one thing that one source of value I have is being skilled at cooking. Yet, I didn’t even say I’m good at it. What gives?\n\nEmotion. Enthusiasm. Passion. Whatever you want to call it, when we hear someone speak about something with emotion we immediately associate that thing with high value. (Except some obvious exceptions of course — if you complain with incredible compassion about how much you hate your boss you’re still not conveying value.) This works just like how we associate high prices with quality.\n\nYou also want to work in some details. They make the mental images you’re creating much more vivid and lend some credibility. If you enjoy cooking like I do, talk about a specific dish you especially enjoyed making; if you run marathons bring out a detail of the last marathon you ran, maybe a specific landmark you were passing as you broke through the wall and hit your runner’s high.\n\nFinally, talking with emotion and enthusiasm does double duty. Just like confidence, it’s not only way of demonstrating your value, zest for life is itself a value. People who can talk about things in an exciting way make us feel excited, we want to be around those people more if for nothing than the energy they bring with them.\n\nIf you found this helpful, I'm building a website with all my articles on seduction: [Stop Beta Shit](http://stopbetashit.com/)","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"media":null,"clicked":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhrv","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When picking up a woman, you have visual and non-visual value.

Show up to the club with your awesome friends and let everyone see you having a good time, and she’ll think you’re a cool, popular guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Proof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Social proof is when you have other people vouch for you being an attractive, quality guy. Again, not telling, but showing. When you go to a bar with a group of friends and you are all joking with each other, have a lot of energy, and are having a good time, that’s social proof. If you were a loser, you wouldn’t be out with a bunch of cool dudes having fun, therefor everyone who sees your group knows you’re not a loser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hanging out with women, especially attractive women, is even better. Why would attractive women hang out with you if you were a low value loser? They wouldn’t. Even if you’re not a very good looking guy, women will assume you must have something else going for you if you can keep the attention of women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re sarging solo, social proof can be harder. In fact, if you’re out alone people may assume that it’s because you don’t have any friends, and so you end up with negative value. To overcome this, start chatting up people as soon as you arrive. Guys, girls, doesn’t matter. Be friendly to everyone. A girl who sees you talking to a couple guys doesn’t know that you just met them. Now you’ve got social proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For sarging solo, you’ll also want to consider doing more day game. It’s normal to be in a bookstore or cafe by yourself, so being alone in that setting doesn’t come with any negative assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confidence is a bit of an odd thing because it’s both a demonstration of value and an actual value itself. We like confident people, they’re just more fun to be around than people who are shy, timid, and never want to go out and have an adventure. But it’s also a way of demonstrating a generalized high value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People are shit at judging value in a vacuum, so we look for clues. As I’ve said, social proof is one clue. Another big clue though is someone’s opinion of himself. No one has greater information about your value than yourself. You’re biased, but you’re also the world’s foremost expert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you act like a beta, show no confidence, and are always apologizing just for taking up space in the world, people will assume this is because you actually are low value. After all, would a really cool high value guy present himself as a piece of shit loser? Andy Kaufman aside, no way. So if you act like a loser it must be because you are one. Girls won’t waste their time trying to tell if your opinion of yourself is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works the same way with being alpha.If you act like you’re an alpha people are very likely to believe you. There’s plenty of reasons to think you’d lie about being alpha, but that’s why I said people believe you when you act alpha. It’s hard to lie through actions, so when you act confident people will assume you have something to be confident in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confidence is also a form of guerrilla social proof. If you approach a girl with confidence and are comfortable talking to her, she will assume that talking to girls is something you do all the time. She hasn’t seen you with girls, but she’ll believe your life is filled with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting confidence is the trick though, and there is no magic bullet fix. Working on actually having value will help (Atomic Game), so will doing an honest assessment of your value (Inner Game). But while you’re working on that other stuff, just give yourself a little bit of positive self-talk, take a deep breath, jump in and remember that simply acting confident gives you some value. The ability to approach a stranger is a rare and admirable trait, so at a bare minimum you have that going for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing Monkey Syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just delivered your opener perfectly, dropped some really funny jokes, everyone laughed a lot, and then you did a couple magic tricks and the set is completely blown away. Too bad you’ve about to be blown out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You’ve contracted Dancing Monkey Syndrome. You’re telling the set you opened that you’re there to entertain them. You might be entertaining, but you’re not attracting them — you’re showing them the desperate lengths you go to just to keep their attention. Opening a complete stranger with a funny joke shows confidence. Continuing the laugh parade shows a lack of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dancing Monkey Syndrome is also incredibly impersonal. You can tell the same jokes the exact same way to someone completely different than the girl you’re talking to, and she knows it. Someone else could also tell her the same joke. There’s absolutely no connection between you. You want to be engaging and interesting, not merely entertaining. If all she wanted was entertainment, there’s always comedy specials on HBO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Showing Isn’t an Option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Show, Don’t Tell is the general rule, but showing isn’t always feasible. You’re not going to ask a girl to wait around for a couple hours while you complete a marathon, odds are the bar kitchen isn’t going to invite you back to show off your skills, and while you can show wealth by spending freely that tends to come across as try-hard and actually pretty insecure about all your other traits. So what does that leave? Telling. Fortunately, there are a couple tricks to make telling your good qualities a lot more effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love to cook, and not just because I like eating, though that’s a nice fringe benefit. What I really like about it is the creative process and the experimentation. You take a bunch of ingredients and transform them into something completely different. And then you do it again and again and over time the recipes slowly evolve and you branch out and experiment. You learn the way different flavors interact, often in really surprising ways, like how a really simple peach glaze takes on a complex, three dimensional flavor when you add just a little bit of dijon mustard. Every time you have one of those little moments where you see a new way of combining ingredients that experience goes into this sort of mental file cabinet that you can draw from in the future, so you’re not just transforming the food — you’re transforming the way you see and think about food. Plus, you know, there’s also the food itself, and you get to eat it. So there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reading that, you probably think that one thing that one source of value I have is being skilled at cooking. Yet, I didn’t even say I’m good at it. What gives?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emotion. Enthusiasm. Passion. Whatever you want to call it, when we hear someone speak about something with emotion we immediately associate that thing with high value. (Except some obvious exceptions of course — if you complain with incredible compassion about how much you hate your boss you’re still not conveying value.) This works just like how we associate high prices with quality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also want to work in some details. They make the mental images you’re creating much more vivid and lend some credibility. If you enjoy cooking like I do, talk about a specific dish you especially enjoyed making; if you run marathons bring out a detail of the last marathon you ran, maybe a specific landmark you were passing as you broke through the wall and hit your runner’s high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, talking with emotion and enthusiasm does double duty. Just like confidence, it’s not only way of demonstrating your value, zest for life is itself a value. People who can talk about things in an exciting way make us feel excited, we want to be around those people more if for nothing than the energy they bring with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you found this helpful, I&amp;#39;m building a website with all my articles on seduction: &lt;a href=\"http://stopbetashit.com/\"&gt;Stop Beta Shit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","media_embed":{},"score":419,"saved":false,"num_reports":null,"created":1372019833.0,"downs":105,"hidden":false,"likes":null,"subreddit":"seduction"}

Long time no see. I am still in the process of getting my degree done and it is **not** fun. And because stuff, food and PC parts are kind of expensive I have to exchange my labour for money. -&gt; Not a lot of time for BaPC, but chilling a bit around /r/photography to learn something for my part-time work.\n\nBut hey, we all like contests and the wiki needs to be filled with useful guides and damn the devil I will do my part! I even have some picture this time, look down in the text!\n\nPC builders, gamers and editors are a hungry bunch. We are very passionate about our components, but please do not forget that with a very similar skillset (research, a bit of trial and error, a lot of reading *guides* on reddit, forums, blogs etc, a methodical work process) you can cook some quick and delicious meals too without relying too much on premade food or frozen pizzas! Cooking is a very scientific process. Modern frontier chefs are using a lot of science to find new ways to prepare and present food, but also century old cooking techniques are very precise chemical reactions. But just following a guide will get you only so far. Like with overclocking you have to tweak and test it, adjust a little bit of that and a little bit here. \n\nSo what I see a lot in gamer's dens and general bachelor households is canned ravioli with tomato sauce. [This stuff here.]( http://i.imgur.com/wvromdQ.jpg) Canned ravioli lands on a rather unflattering very, very low position on my personal *tasty things* rating. Same as premade VS build your own PC - we can do better! A lot better!\n\nI will show you the basic recipe for a pasta dough for the ravioli with ricotta and mozzarella cheese filling together with a very basic tomato sauce. \n\n**For the pasta** - ~ a batch of 20-25 ravioli, a bit on the larger side\n\n**~250g** general purpose flour\n\n**~50g** durum wheat semolina\n**3** eggs\n\n**2** tablespoons olive oil\n\n**3** pinches of salt\n\nA little bit of addition flour on the side\n\n\n**For the filling I use**\n\n**~1** box of ricotta cheese (around 300-400g?)\n\n**2 globes** mozzarella cheese\n\n**1** small lemon\n\n**1-3** tablespoons olive oil\n\n\n**For the tomato sauce**\n\n**1** can of whole tomatoes\n\n**1** small onion\n\n**1** slice of garlic\n\n**a bit* of olive oil for the pan/pot\n\n\n\nGeneral spices: salt, pepper, sugar - bonus for oregano, thyme, parsley and rosemary. Extra bonus for parmigiano reggiano.\n\n\n**Part 1 - Pasta**\nI know, every Italian mama knows best how to make pasta and there are thousands of different ways to make it. This here is only my way of doing it, but please feel absolutely free to adjust every part of my recipe to your taste! I even encourage that! The fun part about cooking is to stray away from already beaten paths. Use recipes as your basics, but change or even improve it on your own. \n\nSo I use a mix of general purpose flour and durum wheat flour for my dough. The durum wheat adds a certain bite to your pasta, like in the al dente way. As far as I know industry made dry pasta is fully durum wheat. For fresh pasta you can absolutely mix your flours or even use fully soft general purpose flour if you like! For me personally the 5:1 mix between GP and durum wheat works quite charmingly. Try it out yourselves, but if while eating you feel it needs more bite add more durum wheat the next time.\n\nIn the same way I've found 3 eggs to work for me to get the right texture for the dough. Mix all the pasta ingredients into a bowl.  Don't be too easy on the salt. Just a little pinch won't do, but we don't need a full tablespoon either. Lucky are the ones with a kitchen machine or a stirrer with dough addon. All the other ones have to use muscle power. Knead until you get an uniform dough, a little bit sticky but not too much. If it is too sticky, like all over your hands sticky, add more flour! If it is too dry and crumbles add another egg! You should get one nice clump of dough in the end in your bowl, easy to form and just a bit sticky. Let it rest in the fridge for around 30 minutes.\n\n**Part 2 - Filling**\n\nIn the meantime to the filling. I have chosen a ricotta-mozzarella mix, because it tastes so very good with tomatoes and it is absolutely easy to make. You can create your own fillings of course, ravioli works with a lot of things. Classic ground beef and mushrooms, salmon, or even greeny things like spinach love to get wrapped in pasta. \n\nJust mix the ricotta and mozzarella into a bowl. Rub off a bit of the lemon zest to add a slight, fresh flavour to your heavy, soft cheese. Fatty things in general have a very good combo with things that gives you a fresh flavour, like citrus fruits (think like duck and oranges, or steak and cranberries). Be careful with the zest, you can easily overpower your cheese, same with the olive oil. Add both of them in small parts to bowl and add more if needed. If you do not have any special tools to get the zest try a very sharp, short blade. Carefully peel the yellow part of the skin and then cut it down in tiny parts. If you just can't get the zest use the lemon juice, but be careful - don't forget, not too much! Season with salt and pepper and every herb you like. Personal opinion - thyme, rosemary, fresh scallions. [Here we have our filling in the mid, right is slow cooked beef with onions and carrots, left is carrots.](http://i.imgur.com/BAfXkKF.jpg)\n\nThat's it! Unto\n\n**Part 3 - Tomato Sauce**\n\nWhy canned tomatoes and not fresh ones? Hey I am lazy as everybody else ;) But even more important most fresh supermarket tomatoes here in Europe, especially in winter are from some mass producing farms in Spain or greenhouse in the Netherlands. Not very tasty, more watery than anything else. But if you can get your hands on some local stuff (looking at you, California) or home-grown tomatoes (quite the work to grow them for the yield you can produce at home, but you cannot believe the flavour explosion) do it of course! If you have fresh ones cut an X into the skin in the bottom and put them for 30-60s into boiling water. They will easily peel. Remove the cores, it's mostly water and seeds and you don't want that in a good sauce. All you need is the delicious flesh.\n\nPut your pan or pot on heat. Add the olive oil when heated and let it rest a bit. Don't put anything in the cold oil at first, you want to have temperature. Cut and dice the onion and the slice of garlic. Cook them in the oil. The heat will reduce the amount of sulphur in the onion, making them less sharp and more sweet. When the onions are glassy add your tomatoes. Use your fork or spatula to press them against then pan or pot to make chunky bits. If you need more fluid add stock or water, but especially with canned tomatoes it should be quite fluid. Let it simmer for a bit to reduce your stock into a nice thick sauce. Season with salt, pepper, oregano and sugar. Tomatoes need sweetness as a counterbalance. If you feel that your sauce misses a certain *baaam* add a little bit of acid - lemon juice or white vinegar. But be careful, especially vinegar can quickly overpower your flavours. \n\nGenerally most meals need a certain kind of balance between salt, sweet and sour and most people are missing the sour part.\n\nSet the sauce aside or let it simmer a bit more to reduce it. The goal is a s nicely thick sauce. Look at the end for a photo!\n\n**Part 4 - Assembly, Cooking, Plating**\n\nWe are nearly done now. Your pasta should be ready by now, get it out of the fridge. As always there is an easy and a hard way now. Pasta machine for the easy way, rolling pin for the hard way. Get some GP flour ready. Your dough will get sticky from handling it, just dust if off with flour to make it non-stick. Also dust your working space, so the dough won't get glued to it. With a pasta machine just form a flat bit of dough and use your widest settings at first. Reduce thickness by one bit each time you go through. Use one hand on the crank and the other one below the machine to pull the pasta a bit. \n\nWith the rolling pin (or even a big drinking glass, like I used because we didn't have any pasta tools ready) you get a free workout. Dust the working space, dough and rolling pin with GP flour and get rolling. I found that using a roll or glass won't get you a thin pasta like with the machine, but for the ricotta-mozzarella ravioli in a thick tomato sauce a thicker pasta with more bite to it works very well.\n\nSpread the pasta on an area where you can easily put the filling on and then easily overlap it. [Look here for an example.](http://i.imgur.com/E4JHUMX.jpg) You also see that I used a cooking brush with normal tap water to paint the dough. This will help get the dough sticky again, so it will seal itself while overlapping. While overlapping don't press down the dough to seal it at first. Start from the sides of the fillings and press down there and wander outside. You want the air trapped with the fillings to go out first before completely gluing the raviolis together. Be careful here to not rip the pasta apart - thicker cuts will be more resistant of course. \n\n[Use a knife or pizza roller to cut out the raviolis.](http://i.imgur.com/QND6PY2.jpg) Waste dough goes into the bowl again with the rest of the pasta, you can easily knead it back in. Once cut press down the edges a little more and force them a bit outwards so the pure pasta part doesn't get too thick. With a fork you can enhance the sealing, press down the edges to get the nice visual touch too. I know that people can use a ravioli roller too, but I still would use the extra work with the fork - you won't want the raviolis to open while cooking.\n\nSet a pot with salt water to boil (don't be shy with the salt) and reheat your sauce. Endgame time. Fresh pasta is done very quickly. If you see the ravioli swimming on the surface add maybe a minute to the time and then you can remove them from the water. Use one ravioli as a test - the exact cooking time depends a lot on the thickness of the pasta.\n\nYour sauce can always wait, but not your pasta. Drain it quickly and then plate it. Don't let pasta rest too much in general, it will get sticky and dry, but give it a second to drain the excess cooking water. If your sauce is too thick add a bit of the salty pasta water. Generally don't add oil to your pasta - freshly drained it won't stick, so quickly plate it or even better let it rest in the sauce!\n\n[Once plated with the sauce give a bit of parsley and parmigiano reggiano on top.](http://i.imgur.com/rs1Ja0K.jpg) We were quite hungry, so we didn’t let the pasta drain to long, you can see that there is still a bit of salt water on the bottom of the plate. If you aim for a more prettier presentation let it drain more. \n\nWe had some leftover pasta, so we also made raviolis with the beef, carrot, onion filling from earlier. Add that to a nice beef-veggie stock and you have [a wonderful wintertime soup.]( http://i.imgur.com/WcM6Zw8.jpg)\n\nDon’t be shy with your feedback. While I liked my results very much, I am quite not so familiar in the pasta world like with other foodstuff. Again this is something that worked well for me, but I am sure it can be improved! Generally I will make the raviolis and fillings a bit smaller next time, they tend to grow a bit while cooking. Smaller portions are also easier on the eyes I think.\n -------\n\nBonus chapter for the people who have read so far: Asian Flavours\n\nYou can easily add Asian flavours to your meals with a couple of sauces, readily available in Asian groceries stores. Fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, siracha sauce. \n\nFish sauce, a very integral part of the Vietnamese cuisine and not unlike the western Worchester sauce is your main player to get saltiness and oomph into your meals. Yes, most Westerners do not like the smell of the pure fish sauce. But it really, really tastes good and once cooked with other ingredients you won’t smell it anymore.  More people are familiar with soy sauce. It is a more subdued saltiness with a bit of sweetness into it. Both sauces complement each other nicely in the saltiness department! Use them as your main flavours in a stir fry for example.\nHoisin and oyster sauces are more thicker and sweeter, but not pure sweet. You will add them to counterbalance the saltiness of the sauces above and to add a glaze for ingredients.\nAnd I think many of you know Siracha sauce. Adds hot and spicy to your food, works as dip as well.\n\nHow do you use them? Often and freely ;) For a stir fry get your stuff cooking on high heat, pure in fish and soy sauce, counter and glaze with oyster sauce, season with pepper and a bit of sugar, add hot and spicy with Siracha.\n\nFor a quick fried rice: Cook onions and garlic, add tomato paste to oil to get it warm. Add the (already cooked, older and dryer is better) rice, use max heat and let it fry. Fish, soy, hoisin, siracha, pepper – done. If you want veggies and meat to the fried rice, cook them beforehand until roughly ~80 percent done and set aside.  Fry your rice, add meat and veggies at the end to finish the cooking and reheat them.\n\nStay sharp, have fun cooking and eat well! ~~~your BaPC chef\n","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"media":null,"clicked":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rnve","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well hello everyone! Long time no see. I am still in the process of getting my degree done and it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; fun. And because stuff, food and PC parts are kind of expensive I have to exchange my labour for money. -&amp;gt; Not a lot of time for BaPC, but chilling a bit around &lt;a href=\"/r/photography\"&gt;/r/photography&lt;/a&gt; to learn something for my part-time work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hey, we all like contests and the wiki needs to be filled with useful guides and damn the devil I will do my part! I even have some picture this time, look down in the text!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PC builders, gamers and editors are a hungry bunch. We are very passionate about our components, but please do not forget that with a very similar skillset (research, a bit of trial and error, a lot of reading &lt;em&gt;guides&lt;/em&gt; on reddit, forums, blogs etc, a methodical work process) you can cook some quick and delicious meals too without relying too much on premade food or frozen pizzas! Cooking is a very scientific process. Modern frontier chefs are using a lot of science to find new ways to prepare and present food, but also century old cooking techniques are very precise chemical reactions. But just following a guide will get you only so far. Like with overclocking you have to tweak and test it, adjust a little bit of that and a little bit here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what I see a lot in gamer&amp;#39;s dens and general bachelor households is canned ravioli with tomato sauce. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/wvromdQ.jpg\"&gt;This stuff here.&lt;/a&gt; Canned ravioli lands on a rather unflattering very, very low position on my personal &lt;em&gt;tasty things&lt;/em&gt; rating. Same as premade VS build your own PC - we can do better! A lot better!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will show you the basic recipe for a pasta dough for the ravioli with ricotta and mozzarella cheese filling together with a very basic tomato sauce. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the pasta&lt;/strong&gt; - ~ a batch of 20-25 ravioli, a bit on the larger side&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~250g&lt;/strong&gt; general purpose flour&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~50g&lt;/strong&gt; durum wheat semolina\n&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; eggs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; tablespoons olive oil&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; pinches of salt&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little bit of addition flour on the side&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the filling I use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~1&lt;/strong&gt; box of ricotta cheese (around 300-400g?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 globes&lt;/strong&gt; mozzarella cheese&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; small lemon&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-3&lt;/strong&gt; tablespoons olive oil&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the tomato sauce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; can of whole tomatoes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; small onion&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; slice of garlic&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;a bit&lt;/em&gt; of olive oil for the pan/pot&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General spices: salt, pepper, sugar - bonus for oregano, thyme, parsley and rosemary. Extra bonus for parmigiano reggiano.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1 - Pasta&lt;/strong&gt;\nI know, every Italian mama knows best how to make pasta and there are thousands of different ways to make it. This here is only my way of doing it, but please feel absolutely free to adjust every part of my recipe to your taste! I even encourage that! The fun part about cooking is to stray away from already beaten paths. Use recipes as your basics, but change or even improve it on your own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I use a mix of general purpose flour and durum wheat flour for my dough. The durum wheat adds a certain bite to your pasta, like in the al dente way. As far as I know industry made dry pasta is fully durum wheat. For fresh pasta you can absolutely mix your flours or even use fully soft general purpose flour if you like! For me personally the 5:1 mix between GP and durum wheat works quite charmingly. Try it out yourselves, but if while eating you feel it needs more bite add more durum wheat the next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the same way I&amp;#39;ve found 3 eggs to work for me to get the right texture for the dough. Mix all the pasta ingredients into a bowl.  Don&amp;#39;t be too easy on the salt. Just a little pinch won&amp;#39;t do, but we don&amp;#39;t need a full tablespoon either. Lucky are the ones with a kitchen machine or a stirrer with dough addon. All the other ones have to use muscle power. Knead until you get an uniform dough, a little bit sticky but not too much. If it is too sticky, like all over your hands sticky, add more flour! If it is too dry and crumbles add another egg! You should get one nice clump of dough in the end in your bowl, easy to form and just a bit sticky. Let it rest in the fridge for around 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2 - Filling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime to the filling. I have chosen a ricotta-mozzarella mix, because it tastes so very good with tomatoes and it is absolutely easy to make. You can create your own fillings of course, ravioli works with a lot of things. Classic ground beef and mushrooms, salmon, or even greeny things like spinach love to get wrapped in pasta. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just mix the ricotta and mozzarella into a bowl. Rub off a bit of the lemon zest to add a slight, fresh flavour to your heavy, soft cheese. Fatty things in general have a very good combo with things that gives you a fresh flavour, like citrus fruits (think like duck and oranges, or steak and cranberries). Be careful with the zest, you can easily overpower your cheese, same with the olive oil. Add both of them in small parts to bowl and add more if needed. If you do not have any special tools to get the zest try a very sharp, short blade. Carefully peel the yellow part of the skin and then cut it down in tiny parts. If you just can&amp;#39;t get the zest use the lemon juice, but be careful - don&amp;#39;t forget, not too much! Season with salt and pepper and every herb you like. Personal opinion - thyme, rosemary, fresh scallions. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/BAfXkKF.jpg\"&gt;Here we have our filling in the mid, right is slow cooked beef with onions and carrots, left is carrots.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it! Unto&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3 - Tomato Sauce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why canned tomatoes and not fresh ones? Hey I am lazy as everybody else ;) But even more important most fresh supermarket tomatoes here in Europe, especially in winter are from some mass producing farms in Spain or greenhouse in the Netherlands. Not very tasty, more watery than anything else. But if you can get your hands on some local stuff (looking at you, California) or home-grown tomatoes (quite the work to grow them for the yield you can produce at home, but you cannot believe the flavour explosion) do it of course! If you have fresh ones cut an X into the skin in the bottom and put them for 30-60s into boiling water. They will easily peel. Remove the cores, it&amp;#39;s mostly water and seeds and you don&amp;#39;t want that in a good sauce. All you need is the delicious flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put your pan or pot on heat. Add the olive oil when heated and let it rest a bit. Don&amp;#39;t put anything in the cold oil at first, you want to have temperature. Cut and dice the onion and the slice of garlic. Cook them in the oil. The heat will reduce the amount of sulphur in the onion, making them less sharp and more sweet. When the onions are glassy add your tomatoes. Use your fork or spatula to press them against then pan or pot to make chunky bits. If you need more fluid add stock or water, but especially with canned tomatoes it should be quite fluid. Let it simmer for a bit to reduce your stock into a nice thick sauce. Season with salt, pepper, oregano and sugar. Tomatoes need sweetness as a counterbalance. If you feel that your sauce misses a certain &lt;em&gt;baaam&lt;/em&gt; add a little bit of acid - lemon juice or white vinegar. But be careful, especially vinegar can quickly overpower your flavours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally most meals need a certain kind of balance between salt, sweet and sour and most people are missing the sour part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set the sauce aside or let it simmer a bit more to reduce it. The goal is a s nicely thick sauce. Look at the end for a photo!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4 - Assembly, Cooking, Plating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are nearly done now. Your pasta should be ready by now, get it out of the fridge. As always there is an easy and a hard way now. Pasta machine for the easy way, rolling pin for the hard way. Get some GP flour ready. Your dough will get sticky from handling it, just dust if off with flour to make it non-stick. Also dust your working space, so the dough won&amp;#39;t get glued to it. With a pasta machine just form a flat bit of dough and use your widest settings at first. Reduce thickness by one bit each time you go through. Use one hand on the crank and the other one below the machine to pull the pasta a bit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the rolling pin (or even a big drinking glass, like I used because we didn&amp;#39;t have any pasta tools ready) you get a free workout. Dust the working space, dough and rolling pin with GP flour and get rolling. I found that using a roll or glass won&amp;#39;t get you a thin pasta like with the machine, but for the ricotta-mozzarella ravioli in a thick tomato sauce a thicker pasta with more bite to it works very well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spread the pasta on an area where you can easily put the filling on and then easily overlap it. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/E4JHUMX.jpg\"&gt;Look here for an example.&lt;/a&gt; You also see that I used a cooking brush with normal tap water to paint the dough. This will help get the dough sticky again, so it will seal itself while overlapping. While overlapping don&amp;#39;t press down the dough to seal it at first. Start from the sides of the fillings and press down there and wander outside. You want the air trapped with the fillings to go out first before completely gluing the raviolis together. Be careful here to not rip the pasta apart - thicker cuts will be more resistant of course. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/QND6PY2.jpg\"&gt;Use a knife or pizza roller to cut out the raviolis.&lt;/a&gt; Waste dough goes into the bowl again with the rest of the pasta, you can easily knead it back in. Once cut press down the edges a little more and force them a bit outwards so the pure pasta part doesn&amp;#39;t get too thick. With a fork you can enhance the sealing, press down the edges to get the nice visual touch too. I know that people can use a ravioli roller too, but I still would use the extra work with the fork - you won&amp;#39;t want the raviolis to open while cooking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set a pot with salt water to boil (don&amp;#39;t be shy with the salt) and reheat your sauce. Endgame time. Fresh pasta is done very quickly. If you see the ravioli swimming on the surface add maybe a minute to the time and then you can remove them from the water.
