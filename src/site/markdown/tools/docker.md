## Docker

Some operating systems come with git pre-installed.

Run from your command line:

    docker version

| Possible result | Explanation |
|-----------------|-------------|
| bash: docker: No such file or directory | You need to install docker |
| Client: Version: < 1.0.0 | You need a newer version of docker |
| Server: Version: < 1.0.0 | You need a newer version of docker |
| Client: Version: > 1.0.0\nServer: Version: > 1.0.0 | You are all good |

If you need to install or upgrade docker, this is a good resource:
