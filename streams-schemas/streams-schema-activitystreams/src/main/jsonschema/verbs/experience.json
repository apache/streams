Note that, depending on the specific object types used for both the actor and object, the meaning of this verb can overlap that of the \"consume\" and \"play\" verbs. For instance, a person might \"experience\" a movie; or \"play\" the movie; or \"consume\" the movie. The \"experience\" verb can be considered a more generic form of other more specific verbs as \"consume\", \"play\", \"watch\", \"listen\", and \"read\"",
